\chapter*{Welcome}\label{welcome}}


\begin{quote}
It's still magic even if you know how it's done.

--- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}
\end{quote}

Software is now as essential to research as telescopes, test tubes, and reference libraries.
This means that researchers \emph{need} to know how to build, check, use, and share programs.
However,
most introductions to programming focus on developing commercial applications,
not on exploring problems whose answers aren't yet known.
Our goal is to show you how to do that,
both on your own and as part of a team.

We believe every researcher should know
how to write short programs that clean and analyze data in a reproducible way
and how to use version control to keep track of what they have done.
But just as some astronomers spend their careers designing telescopes,
some researchers focus on building the software that makes research possible.
People who do this are called \gref{research software engineers}{rse};
the aim of this book is to get you ready for this role by helping you go from
writing code for yourself to creating tools that help your entire field advance.

\hypertarget{intro-big-picture}{%
\section{The Big Picture}\label{intro-big-picture}}

Our approach to research software engineering is based on three related concepts:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \gref{Open science}{open\_science}: Making data, methods, and results
  freely available to all by publishing them under \gref{open
  licenses}{open\_license}.
\item
  \gref{Reproducible research}{reproducible\_research}: Ensuring that anyone
  with access to the data and software can feasibly reproduce results, both to
  check them and to build on them.
\item
  \gref{Sustainable software}{sustainable\_software}: The ease with which to
  maintain and extend it rather than to replace it. Sustainability isn't
  just a property of the software: it also depends on the skills and culture
  of its users.
\end{itemize}

People often conflate these three ideas,
but they are distinct.
For example,
if you share your data and the programs that analyze it,
but don't document what steps to take in what order,
your work is open but not reproducible.
Conversely,
if you completely automate your analysis,
but your data is only available to people in your lab,
your work is reproducible but not open.
Finally,
if a software package is being maintained by a couple of post-docs
who are being paid a fraction of what they could earn in industry
and have no realistic hope of promotion because their field doesn't value tool building,
then sooner or later it will become \gref{abandonware}{abandonware},
at which point openness and reproducibility become less relevant.

Nobody argues that research should be irreproducible or unsustainable,
but \enquote{not against it} and actively supporting it are very different things.
Academia doesn't yet know how to reward people for writing useful software,
so while you may be thanked,
the effort you put in may not translate into academic job security or decent pay.

Some people worry that if they make their data and code publicly available,
someone else will use it and publish a result they could have come up with themselves.
This is almost unheard of in practice,
but that doesn't stop it being used as a scare tactic.
Other people are afraid of looking foolish or incompetent by sharing code that might contain bugs.
This isn't just \gref{impostor syndrome}{impostor\_syndrome}:
members of marginalized groups are frequently judged more harshly than others,
so being wrong in public is much riskier for them.

With this course, we hope to give researchers the tools and knowledge to be
better research software developers, to be more efficient in their work, make
less mistakes, and work more openly and reproducibly.
We hope that by having more researchers with these skills and knowledge,
research culture can improve to address the issues raised above.

\hypertarget{intro-personas}{%
\section{Intended Audience}\label{intro-personas}}

This book is written for researchers who are already using Python for their data analysis,
but who want to take their coding and software development to the next level.
You don't have to be highly proficient with Python,
but you should already be comfortable doing things like reading data from files
and writing loops, conditionals, and functions.
The following personas are examples of the types of people
that are our target audience.

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Amira Khan]
completed a master's in library science five years ago
and has since worked for a small aid organization.
She did some statistics during her degree,
and has learned some R and Python by doing data science courses online,
but has no formal training in programming.
Amira would like to tidy up the scripts, data sets, and reports she has created
in order to share them with her colleagues.
These lessons will show her how to do this.
\item[Jun Hsu]
completed an \href{https://www.insightdatascience.com/}{Insight Data Science} fellowship last year after doing a PhD in Geology
and now works for a company that does forensic audits.
He uses a variety of machine learning and visualization packages,
and would now like to turn some of his own work into an open source project.
This book will show him how such a project should be organized
and how to encourage people to contribute to it.
\item[Sami Virtanen]
became a competent programmer during a bachelor's degree in applied math
and was then hired by the university's research computing center.
The kinds of applications they are being asked to support
have shifted from fluid dynamics to data analysis;
this guide will teach them how to build and run data pipelines
so that they can pass those skills on to their users.
\end{description}

\hypertarget{intro-syllabus}{%
\section{What You Will Learn}\label{intro-syllabus}}

Rather than simply providing reference material about good coding practices,
the book follows Amira and Sami as they work together to write an actual software package
to address a real research question.
The data analysis task that we focus on
relates to a fascinating result in the field of quantitative linguistics.
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf\%27s_law}{Zipf's Law} states that the second most common word in a body of text
appears half as often as the most common,
the third most common appears a third as often, and so on.
To test whether Zipf's Law holds for a collection of classic novels
that are freely available from \href{https://www.gutenberg.org/}{Project Gutenberg},
we write a software package that counts and analyzes the word frequency distribution
in any arbitrary body of text.

In the process of writing and publishing a Python package to verify Zipf's Law,
we will show you how to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Organize small and medium-sized data science projects.
\item
  Use the Unix shell to efficiently manage your data and code.
\item
  Write Python programs that can be used on the command line.
\item
  Use Git and GitHub to track and share your work.
\item
  Work productively in a small team where everyone is welcome.
\item
  Use Make to automate complex workflows.
\item
  Enable users to configure your software without modifying it directly.
\item
  Test your software and know which parts have not yet been tested.
\item
  Find, handle, and fix errors in your code.
\item
  Publish your code and research in open and reproducible ways.
\item
  Create Python packages that can be installed in standard ways.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{intro-using}{%
\section{Using this Book}\label{intro-using}}

This book was written to be used as the material for a (potentially) semester
long course at the university level,
although it can also be used for independent self-study.
Participatory live-coding is the anticipated style for teaching the material,
rather than lectures simply talking about the code presented (Brown and Wilson \protect\hyperlink{ref-Brow2018}{2018}; Wilson \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wils2018}{2019}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wils2018}{a}).
The chapters and their content are generally designed to be used in the order
given.

Chapters are structured with the introduction at the start, content in the middle,
and exercises at the end. Callout boxes are interspersed throughout the content
to be used as a supplement to the main text,
but not a requirement for the course overall.
Early chapters have many small exercises;
later chapters have fewer but larger exercises.
In order to break up long periods of live-coding while teaching,
it may be preferable to stop and complete some of the exercises
at key points throughout the chapter,
rather than waiting until the end.
Possible exercise solutions are provided (Appendix~\ref{solutions}),
in addition to learning objectives (Appendix \ref{objectives})
and key points (Appendix \ref{keypoints}) for each chapter.

\hypertarget{getting-started}{%
\chapter{Getting Started}\label{getting-started}}

\begin{quote}
Everything starts somewhere, though many physicists disagree.

--- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}
\end{quote}

As with many research projects,
the first step in our Zipf's Law analysis
is to download the research data
and install the required software.
Before doing that,
it's worth taking a moment to think about
how we are going to organize everything.
We will soon have a number of books from \href{https://www.gutenberg.org/}{Project Gutenberg}
in the form of a series of text files,
plots we've produced showing the word frequency distribution in each book,
as well as the code we've written to produce those plots
and to document and release our software package.
If we aren't organized from the start,
things could get messy later on.

\hypertarget{getting-started-structure}{%
\section{Project Structure}\label{getting-started-structure}}

Project organization is like a diet:
everyone has one,
it's just a question of whether it's healthy or not.
In the case of a project,
\enquote{healthy} means that people can find what they need and do what they want without becoming frustrated.
This depends on how well organized the project is
and how familiar people are with that style of organization.

As with good coding style,
small pieces in predictable places with readable names are easier to find and use
than large chunks that vary from project to project and have names like \enquote{stuff}.
We can be messy while we are working and then tidy up later,
but experience teaches that we will be more productive if we make tidiness a habit.

In building the Zipf's Law project we'll follow
a widely-used template
for organizing small and medium-sized data analysis projects (Noble \protect\hyperlink{ref-Nobl2009}{2009}).
The project will live in a directory called \texttt{zipf},
which will also be a Git repository stored on GitHub (Chapter~\ref{git-cmdline}).
The following is an abbreviated version of the project directory tree
as it appears towards the end of the book:

\begin{verbatim}
zipf/
├── .gitignore
├── CITATION.md
├── CONDUCT.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE.md
├── README.md
├── Makefile
├── bin
│   ├── book_summary.sh
│   ├── collate.py
│   ├── countwords.py
│   └── ...
├── data
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── dracula.txt
│   ├── frankenstein.txt
│   └── ...
├── docs
│   └── ...
├── results
│   ├── collated.csv
│   ├── dracula.csv
│   ├── dracula.png
│   └── ...
└── ...
\end{verbatim}

The full, final directory tree is documented in Appendix~\ref{tree}.

\hypertarget{getting-started-boilerplate}{%
\subsection{Standard information}\label{getting-started-boilerplate}}

Our project will contain a few standard files
that should be present in every research software project,
open source or otherwise:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{README} includes basic information on our project.
  We'll create it in Chapter~\ref{git-advanced},
  and extend it in Chapter~\ref{packaging}.
\item
  \texttt{LICENSE} is the project's license. We'll add it in Section~\ref{teams-license}.
\item
  \texttt{CONTRIBUTING} explains how to contribute to the project. We'll add it in Section~\ref{teams-documentation}.
\item
  \texttt{CONDUCT} is the project's Code of Conduct. We'll add it in Section~\ref{teams-coc}.
\item
  \texttt{CITATION} explains how to cite the software. We'll add it in Section~\ref{packaging-software-journals}.
\end{itemize}

Some projects also include a \texttt{CONTRIBUTORS} or \texttt{AUTHORS} file that
lists everyone who has contributed to the project,
while others include that information in the \texttt{README} (we do this in Chapter~\ref{git-advanced})
or make it a section in \texttt{CITATION}.
These files are often called \gref{boilerplate}{boilerplate},
meaning they are copied without change from one use to the next.

\hypertarget{getting-started-organize}{%
\subsection{Organizing project content}\label{getting-started-organize}}

Following Noble (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Nobl2009}{2009}),
the directories in the repository's root are organized according to purpose:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Runnable programs go in \texttt{bin/}
  (an old Unix abbreviation for \enquote{binary}, meaning \enquote{not text}).
  This will include both shell scripts,
  e.g.~\texttt{book\_summary.sh} developed in Chapter~\ref{bash-advanced},
  and Python programs,
  e.g.~\texttt{countwords.py}, developed in Chapter~\ref{scripting}.
\item
  Raw data goes in \texttt{data/}
  and is never modified after being stored.
  You'll set up this directory,
  and its contents in Section~\ref{getting-started-download-data}.
\item
  Results are put in \texttt{results/}.
  This includes cleaned-up data,
  figures,
  and everything else created using what's in \texttt{bin} and \texttt{data}.
  In this project,
  we'll describe exactly how \texttt{bin} and \texttt{data} are used
  with \texttt{Makefile} created in Chapter~\ref{automate}.
\item
  Finally,
  documentation and manuscripts go in \texttt{docs/}.
  In this project \texttt{docs} will contain automatically generated
  documentation for the Python package, created in
  Section~\ref{packaging-sphinx}.
\end{itemize}

This structure works well for many computational research projects and
we encourage its use beyond just this book.
We will add some more folders and files not directly addressed by Noble (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Nobl2009}{2009})
when we talk about testing (Chapter~\ref{testing}),
provenance (Chapter~\ref{provenance}),
and packaging (Chapter~\ref{packaging}).

\hypertarget{getting-started-download-data}{%
\section{Downloading the Data}\label{getting-started-download-data}}

The data files used in the book are archived
at an online repository called Figshare (which we discuss in detail in Section~\ref{provenance-data-where})
and can be accessed at:

\url{https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13040516}

We can download a zip file containing the data files by clicking
\enquote{download all} at this URL
and then unzipping the contents into a new \texttt{zipf/data} directory
(also called a \gref{folder}{folder})
that follows the project structure described above.
Here's how things look once we're done:

\begin{verbatim}
zipf/
└── data
    ├── README.md
    ├── dracula.txt
    ├── frankenstein.txt
    ├── jane_eyre.txt
    ├── moby_dick.txt
    ├── sense_and_sensibility.txt
    ├── sherlock_holmes.txt

\section{Installing the Software}\label{getting-started-install-software}}

In order to conduct our analysis we need to install the following software:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A \gref{Bash shell}{shell}
\item
  \gref{Git}{git} version control
\item
  A text editor
\item
  \href{https://www.python.org/}{Python~3} (via the Anaconda distribution)
\item
  \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/make/}{GNU Make}
\end{enumerate}

Comprehensive software installation instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems
(with video tutorials) are maintained by \href{https://carpentries.org/}{The Carpentries}
as part of their workshop website template at:

\url{https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/\#setup}

We can follow those instructions to install the Bash shell, Git, a text editor and Anaconda.

You can check if Make is already on your computer by typing \texttt{make\ -v} into the Bash shell.
If it is not, you can install it as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)}: Install it from the Bash shell using \texttt{sudo\ apt-get\ install\ make}.
\item
  \emph{Mac}: Install \href{https://developer.apple.com/xcode/}{Xcode} (via the App Store).
\item
  \emph{Windows}: Follow the \href{https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/install_ds_stack_windows/\#make}{installation instructions} maintained by the
  Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{conda in the shell on Windows}

If you are using Windows and the \texttt{conda} command isn't available at the Bash shell,
you'll need to open the Anaconda Prompt program (via the Windows start menu)
and run the command \texttt{conda\ init\ bash} (this only needs to be done once).
After that, your shell will be configured to use conda going forward.
\end{quote}

\chapter{The Basics of the Unix Shell}\label{bash-basics}}

\begin{quote}
Ninety percent of most magic merely consists of knowing one extra fact.

--- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}
\end{quote}

Computers do four basic things:
store data,
run programs,
talk with each other,
and interact with people.
They do the interacting in many different ways,
of which \gref{graphical user interfaces}{gui} (GUI) are the most widely used.
The computer displays icons to show our files and programs,
and we tell it to copy or run those by clicking with a mouse.
GUIs are easy to learn but hard to automate,
and don't create a record of what we did.

In contrast,
when we use a \gref{command-line interface}{cli} (CLI)\index{command-line interface}\index{CLI (command-line interface)}
we communicate with the computer by typing commands,
and the computer responds by displaying text.
CLIs existed long before GUIs;
they have survived because they are efficient,
easy to automate,
and automatically record what we have done.

The heart of every CLI is a \gref{read-evaluate-print loop}{repl} (REPL).\index{read-eval-print loop}\index{REPL (read-eval-print loop)}
When we type a command and press Return (also called Enter)
the CLI \textbf{r}eads the command,
\textbf{e}valuates it (i.e., executes it),
\textbf{p}rints the command's output,
and \textbf{l}oops around to wait for another command.
If you have used an interactive console for R or Python,
you have already used a simple CLI.

This lesson introduces another CLI that lets us interact with our computer's operating system.
It is called a \enquote{command shell},
or just \gref{shell}{shell} for short,\index{Unix shell}
and in essence is a program that runs other programs on our behalf
(Figure~\ref{fig:bash-basics-repl}).
Those \enquote{other programs} can do things as simple as telling us the time
or as complex as modeling global climate change;
as long as they obey a few simple rules,
the shell can run them without having to know what language they are written in
or how they do what they do.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{What's in a Name?}

Programmers have written many different shells over the last forty years,
just as they have created many different text editors and plotting packages.
The most popular shell today is called Bash\index{Bash}\index{Unix shell!Bash}
(an acronym of \textbf{B}ourne \textbf{A}gain \textbf{SH}ell,
and a weak pun on the name of its predecessor,
the Bourne shell).
Other shells may differ from Bash in minor ways,
but the core commands and ideas remain the same.
In particular,
the most recent versions of MacOS use a shell called the Z Shell or \texttt{zsh};
we will point out a few differences as we go along.
\end{quote}

Please see Section~\ref{getting-started-install-software} for instructions
on how to install and launch the shell on your computer.

\hypertarget{bash-basics-explore}{%
\section{Exploring Files and Directories}\label{bash-basics-explore}}

Our first shell commands will let us explore our folders and files,
and will also introduce us to several conventions that most Unix tools follow.
To start,
when Bash runs it presents us with a \gref{prompt}{prompt}\index{prompt (in Unix shell)}
to indicate that it is waiting for us to type something.
This prompt is a simple dollar sign by default:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However,
different shells may use a different symbol:
in particular,
the \texttt{zsh} shell that is the default on newer version of MacOS uses \texttt{\%}.
As we'll see in Section~\ref{bash-advanced-vars},
we can customize the prompt to give us more information.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Don't Type the Dollar Sign}

We show the \texttt{\$} prompt so that it's clear what you are supposed to type,
particularly when several commands appear in a row,
but you should \emph{not} type it yourself.
\end{quote}

Let's run a command to find out who the shell thinks we are:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{whoami}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
amira
\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Learn by Doing}

Amira is one of the learners described in Section~\ref{intro-personas}.
For the rest of the book,
we'll present code and examples from her perspective.
You should follow along on your own computer,
though what you see might deviate in small ways because of differences in operating system
(and because your name probably isn't Amira).
\end{quote}

Now that we know who we are,
we can explore where we are and what we have.
The part of the operating system that manages files and directories (also called \gref{folders}{folder})
is called the \gref{filesystem}{filesystem}.\index{filesystem}
Some of the most commonly-used commands in the shell create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.
Let's start exploring them by running the command \texttt{pwd},\index{Unix commands!pwd}
which stands for \textbf{p}rint \textbf{w}orking \textbf{d}irectory.
The \enquote{print} part of its name is straightforward;
the \enquote{working directory} part refers to the fact that
the shell keeps track of our \gref{current working directory}{current\_working\_directory} at all times.\index{current working directory}
Most commands read and write files in the current working directory
unless we tell them to do something else,
so knowing where we are before running a command is important.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{pwd}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
/Users/amira
\end{verbatim}

Here,
the computer's response is \texttt{/Users/amira},
which tells us that we are in a directory called \texttt{amira}
that is contained in a top-level directory called \texttt{Users}.
This directory is Amira's \gref{home directory}{home\_directory};\index{home directory}
to understand what that means,
we must first understand how the filesystem is organized.
On Amira's computer
it looks like Figure~\ref{fig:bash-basics-filesystem}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/bash-basics/sample-filesystem} 

}

\caption{A sample filesystem.}\label{fig:bash-basics-filesystem}
\end{figure}

At the top is the \gref{root directory}{root\_directory} that holds everything else,\index{root directory}
which we can refer to using a slash character \texttt{/} on its own.
Inside that directory are several other directories,
including \texttt{bin} (where some built-in programs are stored),
\texttt{data} (for miscellaneous data files),
\texttt{tmp} (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),
and \texttt{Users} (where users' personal directories are located).
We know that \texttt{/Users} is stored inside the root directory \texttt{/} because its name begins with \texttt{/},
and that our current working directory \texttt{/Users/amira} is stored inside \texttt{/Users}
because \texttt{/Users} is the first part of its name.
A name like this is called a \gref{path}{path} because it tells us\index{path}
how to get from one place in the filesystem (e.g., the root directory)
to another (e.g., Amira's home directory).

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Slashes}

The \texttt{/} character means two different things in a path.
At the front of a path or on its own,
it refers to the root directory.
When it appears inside a name, it is a separator.
Windows uses backslashes (\texttt{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}}) instead of forward slashes as separators.
\end{quote}

Underneath \texttt{/Users},
we find one directory for each user with an account on this machine.
Jun's files are stored in \texttt{/Users/jun},
Sami's in \texttt{/Users/sami},
and Amira's in \texttt{/Users/amira}.
This is where the name \enquote{home directory} comes from:
when we first log in,
the shell puts us in the directory that holds our files.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Home Directory Variations}

Our home directory will be in different places on different operating systems.
On Linux it may be \texttt{/home/amira},
and on Windows it may be \texttt{C:\textbackslash{}Documents\ and\ Settings\textbackslash{}amira} or \texttt{C:\textbackslash{}Users\textbackslash{}amira}
(depending on the version of Windows).
Our examples show what we would see on MacOS.
\end{quote}

Now that we know where we are,
let's see what we have using the command \texttt{ls}\index{Unix commands!ls}
(short for \enquote{listing}),
which prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Applications   Downloads     Music        opt
Desktop        Library       Pictures     todo.txt
Documents      Movies        Public       zipf
\end{verbatim}

Again,
our results may be different depending on our operating system
and what files or directories we have.

We can make the output of \texttt{ls} more informative using the \texttt{-F} \gref{option}{command\_line\_option}\index{option (of shell command)}\index{command-line option}
(also sometimes called a \gref{switch}{command\_line\_switch} or a \gref{flag}{command\_line\_flag}).
Options are exactly like arguments to a function in R or Python;
in this case,
\texttt{-F} tells \texttt{ls} to decorate its output to show what things are.
A trailing \texttt{/} indicates a directory,
while a trailing \texttt{*} tells us something is a runnable program.
Depending on our setup,
the shell might also use colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or directory.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ -F}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Applications/   Downloads/     Music/        opt/
Desktop/        Library/       Pictures/     todo.txt
Documents/      Movies/        Public/       zipf/
\end{verbatim}

Here,
we can see that almost everything in our home directory is a \gref{subdirectory}{subdirectory};\index{subdirectory}
the only thing that isn't is a file called \texttt{todo.txt}.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Spaces Matter}

\texttt{1+2} and \texttt{1~+~2} mean the same thing in mathematics,
but \texttt{ls~-F} and \texttt{ls-F} are very different things in the shell.
The shell splits whatever we type into pieces based on spaces,
so if we forget to separate \texttt{ls} and \texttt{-F} with at least one space,
the shell will try to find a program called \texttt{ls-F} and (quite sensibly)
give an error message like \texttt{ls-F:\ command\ not\ found}.
\end{quote}

Some options tell a command how to behave,
but others tell it what to act on.
For example,
if we want to see what's in the \texttt{/Users} directory,
we can type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ /Users}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
amira   jun     sami
\end{verbatim}

We often call the file and directory names that we give to commands \gref{arguments}{command\_line\_argument}\index{argument (of shell command)}
to distinguish them from the built-in options.
We can combine options and arguments:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ -F /Users}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
amira/  jun/    sami/
\end{verbatim}

but we must put the options (like \texttt{-F})
before the names of any files or directories we want to work on,
because once the command encounters something that \emph{isn't} an option
it assumes there aren't any more:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ /Users -F}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
ls: -F: No such file or directory
amira   jun     sami
\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Command Line Differences}

Code can sometimes behave in unexpected ways on different computers,
and this applies to the command line as well.
For example,
the following code actually \emph{does} work on some Linux operating systems:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ /Users -F}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Some people think this is convenient;
others (including us) believe it is confusing,
so it's best to avoid doing this.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{bash-basics-navigate}{%
\section{Moving Around}\label{bash-basics-navigate}}

Let's run \texttt{ls} again.
Without any arguments,
it shows us what's in our current working directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ -F}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Applications/   Downloads/     Music/        opt/
Desktop/        Library/       Pictures/     todo.txt
Documents/      Movies/        Public/       zipf/
\end{verbatim}

If we want to see what's in the \texttt{zipf} directory
we can ask \texttt{ls} to list its contents:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ -F zipf}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
data/
\end{verbatim}

Notice that \texttt{zipf} doesn't have a leading slash before its name.
This absence tells the shell that it is a \gref{relative path}{relative\_path},\index{relative path}\index{path!relative}
i.e.,
that it identifies something starting from our current working directory.
In contrast,
a path like \texttt{/Users/amira} is an \gref{absolute path}{absolute\_path}:\index{absolute path}\index{path!absolute}
it is always interpreted from the root directory down,
so it always refers to the same thing.
Using a relative path is like telling someone to go two kilometers north and then half a kilometer east;
using an absolute path is like giving them the latitude and longitude of their destination.

We can use whichever kind of path is easiest to type,
but if we are going to do a lot of work with the data in the \texttt{zipf} directory,
the easiest thing would be to change our current working directory
so that we don't have to type \texttt{zipf} over and over again.
The command to do this is \texttt{cd},\index{Unix commands!cd}
which stands for \textbf{c}hange \textbf{d}irectory.
This name is a bit misleading because the command doesn't change the directory;
instead, it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.
Let's try it out:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ zipf}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\texttt{cd} doesn't print anything.
This is normal:
many shell commands run silently unless something goes wrong,
on the theory that they should only ask for our attention when they need it.
To confirm that \texttt{cd} has done what we asked,
we can use \texttt{pwd}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{pwd}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
/Users/amira/zipf
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ -F}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
data/
\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Missing Directories and Unknown Options}

If we give a command an option that it doesn't understand,
it will usually print an error message and (if we're lucky)
tersely remind us of what we should have done:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ -j}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
-bash: cd: -j: invalid option
cd: usage: cd [-L|-P] [dir]
\end{verbatim}

On the other hand,
if we get the syntax right but make a mistake in the name of a file or directory,
it will tell us that:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ whoops}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
-bash: cd: whoops: No such file or directory
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

We now know how to go down the directory tree,
but how do we go up?
This doesn't work:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ amira}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
cd: amira: No such file or directory
\end{verbatim}

because \texttt{amira} on its own is a relative path meaning
\enquote{a file or directory called \texttt{amira} \emph{below our current working directory}}.
To get back home,
we can either use an absolute path:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ /Users/amira}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or a special relative path called \texttt{..} (two periods in a row with no spaces),\index{.. (parent directory)}\index{path!..}
which always means \enquote{the directory that contains the current one}.
The directory that contains the one we are in is called the \gref{parent directory}{parent\_directory},\index{parent directory}
and sure enough,
\texttt{..} gets us there:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ..}
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{pwd}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
/Users/amira
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{ls} usually doesn't show us this special directory---since it's always there,
displaying it every time would be a distraction.
We can ask \texttt{ls} to include it using the \texttt{-a} option,
which stands for \enquote{all}.
Remembering that we are now in \texttt{/Users/amira}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ -F -a}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
./              Documents/     Music/        todo.txt
../             Downloads/     Pictures/     zipf/
Applications/   Library/       Public/ 
Desktop/        Movies/        opt/
\end{verbatim}

The output also shows another special directory called \texttt{.} (a single period),\index{path!.}\index{. (current working directory)}
which refers to the current working directory.
It may seem redundant to have a name for it,
but we'll see some uses for it soon.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Combining Options}

You'll occasionally need to use multiple options in the same command.
In most command line tools,
multiple options can be combined with a single \texttt{-}
and no spaces between the options:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ -Fa}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This command is synonymous with the previous example.
While you may see commands written like this,
we don't recommend you use this approach in your own work.
This is because some commands take \gref{long options}{long\_option}
with multi-letter names,
and it's very easy to mistake \texttt{-\/-no} (meaning \enquote{answer \enquote{no} to all questions})
with \texttt{-no} (meaning \texttt{-n\ -o}).
\end{quote}

The special names \texttt{.} and \texttt{..} don't belong to \texttt{cd}:
they mean the same thing to every program.
For example,
if we are in \texttt{/Users/amira/zipf},
then \texttt{ls~..} will display a listing of \texttt{/Users/amira}.
When the meanings of the parts are the same no matter how they're combined,
programmers say they are \gref{orthogonal}{orthogonality}.
Orthogonal systems tend to be easier for people to learn
because there are fewer special cases to remember.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Other Hidden Files}

In addition to the hidden directories \texttt{..} and \texttt{.},
we may also comes across files with names like \texttt{.jupyter} or \texttt{.Rhistory}.
These usually contain settings or other data for particular programs;
the prefix \texttt{.} is used to prevent \texttt{ls} from cluttering up the output
when we run \texttt{ls}.
We can always use the \texttt{-a} option to display them.
\end{quote}

\texttt{cd} is a simple command,
but it allows us to explore several new ideas.
First,
several \texttt{..} can be joined by the path separator
to move higher than the parent directory in a single step.
For example, \texttt{cd~../..} will move us up two directories
(e.g., from \texttt{/Users/amira/zipf} to \texttt{/Users}),
while \texttt{cd~../Movies} will move us up from \texttt{zipf} and back down into \texttt{Movies}.

What happens if we type \texttt{cd} on its own without giving a directory?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{pwd}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
/Users/amira/Movies
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{pwd}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
/Users/amira
\end{verbatim}

No matter where we are,
\texttt{cd} on its own always returns us to our home directory.
We can achieve the same thing using the special directory name \texttt{\textasciitilde{}},\index{\char`\~\ (home directory)}\index{home directory!\char`\~\ (alias for)}
which is a shortcut for our home directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ ~}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Applications   Downloads     Music        opt
Desktop        Library       Pictures     todo.txt
Documents      Movies        Public       zipf
\end{verbatim}

(\texttt{ls} doesn't show any trailing slashes here because we haven't used \texttt{-F}.)
We can use \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} in paths,
so that (for example) \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/Downloads} always refers to our download directory.

Finally,
\texttt{cd} interprets the shortcut \texttt{-} (a single dash) to mean the last directory we were in.
Using this is usually faster and more reliable than trying to remember and type the path,
but unlike \texttt{\textasciitilde{}},
it only works with \texttt{cd}:
\texttt{ls~-} tries to print a listing of a directory called \texttt{-}
rather than showing us the contents of our previous directory.

\hypertarget{bash-basics-filedir}{%
\section{Creating New Files and Directories}\label{bash-basics-filedir}}

We now know how to explore files and directories,
but how do we create them?
To find out,
let's go back to our \texttt{zipf} directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ~/zipf}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ -F}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
data/
\end{verbatim}

To create a new directory,
we use the command \texttt{mkdir} (short for \textbf{m}a\textbf{k}e \textbf{d}irectory):\index{Unix commands!mkdir}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mkdir}\NormalTok{ docs}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Since \texttt{docs} is a relative path
(i.e., does not have a leading slash)
the new directory is created below the current working directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ -F}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
data/  docs/
\end{verbatim}

Using the shell to create a directory is no different than using a graphical tool.
If we look at the current directory with our computer's file browser
we will see the \texttt{docs} directory there too.
The shell and the file explorer are two different ways of interacting with the files;
the files and directories themselves are the same.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Naming Files and Directories}

Complicated names of files and directories can make our life painful.
Following a few simple rules can save a lot of headaches:\index{filesystem!naming conventions}\index{naming conventions!filesystem}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Don't use spaces.}
  Spaces can make a name easier to read,
  but since they are used to separate arguments on the command line,
  most shell commands interpret a name like \texttt{My\ Thesis} as two names \texttt{My} and \texttt{Thesis}.
  Use \texttt{-} or \texttt{\_} instead,
  e.g, \texttt{My-Thesis} or \texttt{My\_Thesis}.
\item
  \textbf{Don't begin the name with \texttt{-} (dash)}
  to avoid confusion with command options like \texttt{-F}.
\item
  \textbf{Stick with letters, digits, \texttt{.} (period or \enquote{full stop}), \texttt{-} (dash) and \texttt{\_} (underscore).}
  Many other characters mean special things in the shell.
  We will learn about some of these during this lesson,
  but these are always safe.
\end{enumerate}

If we need to refer to files or directories that have spaces or other special characters in their names,
we can surround the name in quotes (\texttt{""}).
For example, \texttt{ls\ "My\ Thesis"} will work where \texttt{ls\ My\ Thesis} does not.
\end{quote}

Since we just created the \texttt{docs} directory,
\texttt{ls} doesn't display anything when we ask for a listing of its contents:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ -F docs}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's change our working directory to \texttt{docs} using \texttt{cd},
then use a very simple text editor called \gref{Nano}{nano\_editor} to create a file called \texttt{draft.txt}\index{Nano editor}
(Figure~\ref{fig:bash-basics-nano}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ docs}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{nano}\NormalTok{ draft.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/bash-basics/nano-editor} 

}

\caption{The Nano editor.}\label{fig:bash-basics-nano}
\end{figure}

When we say \enquote{Nano is a text editor} we really do mean \enquote{text}:
it can only work with plain character data,
not spreadsheets, images, Microsoft Word files, or anything else invented after 1970.
We use it in this lesson because it runs everywhere,
and because it is as simple as something can be and still be called an editor.
However,
that last trait means that we \emph{shouldn't} use it for larger tasks
like writing a program or a paper.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Recycling Pixels}

Unlike most modern editors,
Nano runs \emph{inside} the shell window instead of opening a new window of its own.
This is a holdover from an era when graphical terminals were a rarity
and different applications had to share a single screen.
\end{quote}

Once Nano is open we can type in a few lines of text,
then press Ctrl+O
(the Control key and the letter \enquote{O} at the same time)
to save our work.
Nano will ask us what file we want to save it to;
press Return to accept the suggested default of \texttt{draft.txt}.
Once our file is saved,
we can use Ctrl+X to exit the editor and return to the shell.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Control, Ctrl, or \^{} Key}

The Control key,
also called the \enquote{Ctrl} key,
can be described in a bewildering variety of ways.
For example,
Control plus X may be written as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{Control-X}
\item
  \texttt{Control+X}
\item
  \texttt{Ctrl-X}
\item
  \texttt{Ctrl+X}
\item
  \texttt{C-x}
\item
  \texttt{\^{}X}
\end{itemize}

When Nano runs
it displays some help in the bottom two lines of the screen
using the last of these notations:
for example,
\texttt{\^{}G\ Get\ Help} means \enquote{use Control+G to get help}
and \texttt{\^{}O\ WriteOut} means \enquote{use Control+O to write out the current file}.
\end{quote}

Nano doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,
but \texttt{ls} will show that we have indeed created a new file \texttt{draft.txt}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
draft.txt
\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Dot Something}

All of Amira's files are named \enquote{something dot something}.
This is just a convention:
we can call a file \texttt{mythesis} or almost anything else.
However,
both people and programs use two-part names to help them tell different kinds of files apart.
The part of the filename after the dot
is called the \gref{filename extension}{filename\_extension}\index{filename extension}
and indicates what type of data the file holds:
\texttt{.txt} for plain text,
\texttt{.pdf} for a PDF document,
\texttt{.png} for a PNG image, and so on.
This is just a convention:
saving a PNG image of a whale as \texttt{whale.mp3}
doesn't somehow magically turn it into a recording of whalesong,
though it \emph{might} cause the operating system to try to open it with a music player
when someone double-clicks it.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{bash-basics-move}{%
\section{Moving Files and Directories}\label{bash-basics-move}}

Let's go back to our \texttt{zipf} directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ~/zipf}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{docs} directory contains a file called \texttt{draft.txt}.
That isn't a particularly informative name,
so let's change it using \texttt{mv} (short for \textbf{m}o\textbf{v}e):\index{Unix commands!mv}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mv}\NormalTok{ docs/draft.txt docs/prior-work.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The first argument tells \texttt{mv} what we are \enquote{moving},
while the second is where it's to go.
\enquote{Moving} \texttt{docs/draft.txt} to \texttt{docs/prior-work.txt}
has the same effect as renaming the file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ docs}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
prior-work.txt
\end{verbatim}

We must be careful when specifying the destination
because \texttt{mv} will overwrite existing files without warning.
An option \texttt{-i} (for \enquote{interactive}) makes \texttt{mv} ask us for confirmation before overwriting.
\texttt{mv} also works on directories,
so \texttt{mv\ analysis\ first-paper} would rename the directory without changing its contents.

Now suppose we want to move \texttt{prior-work.txt} into the current working directory.
If we don't want to change the file's name,
just its location,
we can provide \texttt{mv} with a directory as a destination
and it will move the file there.
In this case,
the directory we want is the special name \texttt{.} that we mentioned earlier:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mv}\NormalTok{ docs/prior-work.txt .}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\texttt{ls} now shows us that \texttt{docs} is empty:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ docs}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and that our current directory now contains our file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
data/  docs/  prior-work.txt
\end{verbatim}

If we only want to check that the file exists,
we can give its name to \texttt{ls}
just like we can give the name of a directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ prior-work.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
prior-work.txt
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{bash-basics-copy}{%
\section{Copying Files and Directories}\label{bash-basics-copy}}

The \texttt{cp} command \textbf{c}o\textbf{p}ies files.\index{Unix commands!cp}
It works like \texttt{mv} except it creates a file instead of moving an existing one:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cp}\NormalTok{ prior-work.txt docs/section-1.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can check that \texttt{cp} did the right thing
by giving \texttt{ls} two arguments
to ask it to list two things at once:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ prior-work.txt docs/section-1.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
docs/section-1.txt  prior-work.txt
\end{verbatim}

Notice that \texttt{ls} shows the output in alphabetical order.
If we leave off the second filename and ask it to show us a file and a directory
(or multiple directories)
it lists them one by one:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ prior-work.txt docs}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
prior-work.txt

docs:
section-1.txt
\end{verbatim}

Copying a directory and everything it contains is a little more complicated.
If we use \texttt{cp} on its own,
we get an error message:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cp}\NormalTok{ docs backup}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
cp: analysis is a directory (not copied).
\end{verbatim}

If we really want to copy everything,
we must give \texttt{cp} the \texttt{-r} option (meaning \gref{recursive}{recursion}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cp}\NormalTok{ -r docs backup}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Once again we can check the result with \texttt{ls}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ docs backup}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
docs/:
section-1.txt

backup/:
section-1.txt
\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Copying Files to and from Remote Computers}

For many researchers,
a motivation for learning how to use the shell
is that it's often the only way to connect to a remote computer
(e.g.~located at a supercomputing facility or in a university department).

Similar to the \texttt{cp} command,
there exists a \textbf{s}ecure \textbf{c}o\textbf{p}y (\texttt{scp}) command for
copying files between computers.
See Appendix \ref{ssh} for details, including how to set up
a secure connection to a remote computer via the shell.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{bash-basics-rm}{%
\section{Deleting Files and Directories}\label{bash-basics-rm}}

Let's tidy up by removing the \texttt{prior-work.txt} file we created in our \texttt{zipf} directory.
The command to do this is \texttt{rm} (for \textbf{r}e\textbf{m}ove):\index{Unix commands!rm}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{rm}\NormalTok{ prior-work.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can confirm the file is gone using \texttt{ls}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ prior-work.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
ls: prior-work.txt: No such file or directory
\end{verbatim}

Deleting is forever:
unlike most GUIs,
the Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin that we can recover deleted files from.
Tools for finding and recovering deleted files do exist,
but there is no guarantee they will work,
since the computer may recycle the file's disk space at any time.
In most cases,
when we delete a file it really is gone.

In a half-hearted attempt to stop us from erasing things accidentally,
\texttt{rm} refuses to delete directories:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{rm}\NormalTok{ docs}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
rm: docs: is a directory
\end{verbatim}

We can tell \texttt{rm} we really want to do this
by giving it the recursive option \texttt{-r}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{rm}\NormalTok{ -r docs}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\texttt{rm\ -r} should be used with great caution:
in most cases,
it's safest to add the \texttt{-i} option (for \textbf{i}nteractive)
to get \texttt{rm} to ask us to confirm each deletion.
As a halfway measure,
we can use \texttt{-v} (for \textbf{v}erbose)
to get \texttt{rm} to print a message for each file it deletes.
This option works the same way with \texttt{mv} and \texttt{cp}.

\hypertarget{bash-basics-wildcard}{%
\section{Wildcards}\label{bash-basics-wildcard}}

\texttt{zipf/data} contains the text files for several ebooks
from \href{https://www.gutenberg.org/}{Project Gutenberg}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ data}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
README.md         moby_dick.txt
dracula.txt       sense_and_sensibility.txt
frankenstein.txt  sherlock_holmes.txt
jane_eyre.txt     time_machine.txt
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{wc} command (short for \textbf{w}ord \textbf{c}ount)\index{Unix commands!wc}
tells us how many lines, words, and letters there are in one file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ data/moby_dick.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 22331  215832 1276222 data/moby_dick.txt
\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{What's in a Word?}

\texttt{wc} only considers spaces to be word breaks:
if two words are connected by a long dash---like \enquote{dash} and \enquote{like}
in this sentence---then \texttt{wc} will count them as one word.
\end{quote}

We could run \texttt{wc} more times to find out how many lines there are in the other files,
but that would be a lot of typing
and we could easily make a mistake.
We can't just give \texttt{wc} the name of the directory as we do with \texttt{ls}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ data}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
wc: data: read: Is a directory
\end{verbatim}

Instead,
we can use \gref{wildcards}{wildcard} to specify a set of files at once.\index{wildcard!in Unix shell}
The most commonly-used wildcard is \texttt{*} (a single asterisk).
It matches zero or more characters,
so \texttt{data/*.txt} matches all of the text files in the \texttt{data} directory:

\begin{verbatim}
$ ls data/*.txt
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
data/dracula.txt       data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
data/frankenstein.txt  data/sherlock_holmes.txt
data/jane_eyre.txt     data/time_machine.txt
data/moby_dick.txt
\end{verbatim}

while \texttt{data/s*.txt} only matches the two whose names begin with an \enquote{s}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ data/s*.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
data/sense_and_sensibility.txt  data/sherlock_holmes.txt
\end{verbatim}

Wildcards are expanded to match filenames \emph{before} commands are run,
so they work exactly the same way for every command.
This means that we can use them with \texttt{wc} to (for example)
count the number of words in the books with names that contains an underscore:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ data/*_*.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  21054  188460 1049294 data/jane_eyre.txt
  22331  215832 1253891 data/moby_dick.txt
  13028  121593  693116 data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053  107536  581903 data/sherlock_holmes.txt
   3582   35527  200928 data/time_machine.txt
  73048  668948 3779132 total
\end{verbatim}

or the number of words in Frankenstein:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ data/frank*.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  7832  78100 442967 data/frankenstein.txt
\end{verbatim}

The exercises will introduce and explore other wildcards.
For now,
we only need to know that
it's possible for a wildcard expression to \emph{not} match anything.
In this case,
the command will usually print an error message:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ data/*.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
wc: data/*.csv: open: No such file or directory
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{bash-basics-help}{%
\section{Reading the Manual}\label{bash-basics-help}}

\texttt{wc} displays lines, words, and characters by default,
but we can ask it to display only the number of lines:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ -l data/s*.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
  26081 total
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{wc} has other options as well.
We can use the \texttt{man} command (short for \textbf{man}ual)\index{Unix commands!man}\index{Unix shell!manual}
to find out what they are:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{man}\NormalTok{ wc}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Paging Through the Manual}

If our screen is too small to display an entire manual page at once,
the shell will use a \gref{paging program}{pager} called \texttt{less} to show it
piece by piece.\index{Unix shell!paging program}\index{paging program (in Unix shell)}
We can use ↑ and ↓ to move line-by-line
or Ctrl+Spacebar and Spacebar
to skip up and down one page at a time.
(B and F also work.)

To search for a character or word,
use / followed by the character or word to search for.
If the search produces multiple hits,
we can move between them using N (for \enquote{next}).
To quit, press Q.
\end{quote}

Manual pages contain a lot of information---often more than we really want.
Figure~\ref{fig:bash-basics-nano}
includes excerpts from the manual on your screen,
and highlights a few of features useful for beginners.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/bash-basics/man-callouts}

\caption{Key features of Unix manual pages.}\label{fig:bash-basics-manual}
\end{figure}

Some commands have a \texttt{-\/-help} option that provides a succinct summary of possibilities,
but the best place to go for help these days is probably the \href{https://tldr.sh/}{TLDR} website.
The acronym stands for \enquote{too long, didn't read},
and its help for \texttt{wc} displays this:

\begin{verbatim}
wc
Count words, bytes, or lines.

Count lines in file:
wc -l {{file}}

Count words in file:
wc -w {{file}}

Count characters (bytes) in file:
wc -c {{file}}

Count characters in file (taking multi-byte character sets into
account):
wc -m {{file}}

edit this page on github
\end{verbatim}

As the last line suggests,
all of its examples are in a public GitHub repository
so that users like you can add the examples you wish it had.
For more information,
we can search on \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bash}{Stack Overflow}
or browse the \href{https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html}{GNU manuals}
(particularly those for the \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html}{core GNU utilities},
which include many of the commands introduced in this lesson).
In all cases,
though,
we need to have some idea of what we're looking for in the first place:
someone who wants to know how many lines there are in a data file
is unlikely to think to look for \texttt{wc}.

\hypertarget{bash-basics-summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{bash-basics-summary}}

The original Unix shell is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary.

The exercises below involve creating and moving new files,
as well as considering hypothetical files.
Please note that if you create or move any files or directories in your Zipf's Law project,
you may want to reorganize your files following the outline at the beginning of the next chapter.
If you accidentally delete necessary files,
you can start with a fresh copy of the data files
by following the instructions in Section~\ref{getting-started-download-data}.

The command \texttt{ls\ -t} lists things by time of last change,
with most recently changed files or directories first.

In what order does \texttt{ls\ -R\ -t} display things? Hint: \texttt{ls\ -l} uses a long listing

\begin{quote}
Wisdom comes from experience. Experience is often a result of lack of wisdom.

--- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}
\end{quote}

The shell's greatest strength is that
it lets us combine programs to create pipelines
that can handle large volumes of data.
This lesson shows how to do that,
and how to repeat commands to process as many files as we want automatically.

We'll be continuing to work in the \texttt{zipf} project,
which after the previous chapter should contain the following files:

\begin{verbatim}
zipf/
└── data
    ├── README.md
    ├── dracula.txt
    ├── frankenstein.txt
    ├── jane_eyre.txt
    ├── moby_dick.txt
    ├── sense_and_sensibility.txt
    ├── sherlock_holmes.txt
    └── time_machine.txt
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{bash-tools-pipe}{%
\section{Combining Commands}\label{bash-tools-pipe}}

To see how the shell lets us combine commands,
let's go into the \texttt{zipf/data} directory
and count the number of lines in each file once again:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ~/zipf/data}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ -l *.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

  15975 dracula.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  21054 jane_eyre.txt
  22331 moby_dick.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
   3582 time_machine.txt
  96855 total
\end{verbatim}

Which of these books is shortest?
We can check by eye when there are only 16 files,
but what if there were eight thousand?

Our first step toward a solution is to run this command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ -l *.txt }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ lengths.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The greater-than symbol \texttt{\textgreater{}} tells the shell
to \gref{redirect}{redirection} the command's output to a file instead of printing it.\index{redirection (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix shell!redirection}
Nothing appears on the screen;
instead,
everything that would have appeared has gone into the file \texttt{lengths.txt}.
The shell creates this file if it doesn't exist,
or overwrites it if it already exists.

We can print the contents of \texttt{lengths.txt} using \texttt{cat},\index{Unix commands!cat}
which is short for con\textbf{cat}enate
(because if we give it the names of several files
it will print them all in order):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cat}\NormalTok{ lengths.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  15975 dracula.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  21054 jane_eyre.txt
  22331 moby_dick.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
   3582 time_machine.txt
  96855 total
\end{verbatim}

We can now use \texttt{sort} to sort the lines in this file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{sort}\NormalTok{ lengths.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
   3582 time_machine.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
  15975 dracula.txt
  21054 jane_eyre.txt
  22331 moby_dick.txt
  96855 total
\end{verbatim}

Just to be safe,
we should use \texttt{sort}'s \texttt{-n} option to specify that we want to sort numerically.
Without it,
\texttt{sort} would order things alphabetically
so that \texttt{10} would come before \texttt{2}.

\texttt{sort} does not change \texttt{lengths.txt}.
Instead,
it sends its output to the screen just as \texttt{wc} did.
We can therefore put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called \texttt{sorted-lengths.txt}
using \texttt{\textgreater{}} once again:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{sort}\NormalTok{ lengths.txt }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ sorted-lengths.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Redirecting to the Same File}

It's tempting to send the output of \texttt{sort} back to the file it reads:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{sort}\NormalTok{ -n lengths.txt }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ lengths.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However, all this does is wipe out the contents of \texttt{lengths.txt}.
The reason is that when the shell sees the redirection,
it opens the file on the right of the \texttt{\textgreater{}} for writing,
which erases anything that file contained.
It then runs \texttt{sort}, which finds itself reading from a newly-empty file.
\end{quote}

Creating intermediate files with names like \texttt{lengths.txt} and \texttt{sorted-lengths.txt} works,
but keeping track of those files and cleaning them up when they're no longer needed is a burden.
Let's delete the two files we just created:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rm}\NormalTok{ lengths.txt sorted-lengths.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can produce the same result more safely and with less typing
using a \gref{pipe}{pipe\_shell}:\index{pipe (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix shell!pipe}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ -l *.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{sort}\NormalTok{ -n}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
   3582 time_machine.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
  15975 dracula.txt
  21054 jane_eyre.txt
  22331 moby_dick.txt
  96855 total
\end{verbatim}

The vertical bar \texttt{\textbar{}} between the \texttt{wc} and \texttt{sort} commands
tells the shell that we want to use the output of the command on the left
as the input to the command on the right.

Running a command with a file as input has a clear flow of information:
the command performs a task on that file and prints the output to the screen
(Figure~\ref{fig:bash-tools-pipe}a).
When using pipes, however,
the information flows differently after the first (upstream) command.
The downstream command doesn't read from a file.
Instead,
it reads the output of the upstream command
(Figure~\ref{fig:bash-tools-pipe}b).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/bash-tools/pipe} 

}

\caption{Piping commands.}\label{fig:bash-tools-pipe}
\end{figure}

We can use \texttt{\textbar{}} to build pipes of any length.
For example,
we can use the command \texttt{head} to get just the first three lines of sorted data,\index{Unix commands!head}
which shows us the three shortest books:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ -l *.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{sort}\NormalTok{ -n }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
   3582 time_machine.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Options Can Have Values}

When we write \texttt{head\ -n\ 3},
the value 3 is not input to \texttt{head}.
Instead, it is associated with the option \texttt{-n}.
Many options take values like this,
such as the names of input files or the background color to use in a plot.
Some versions of \texttt{head} may allow you to use \texttt{head\ -3} as a shortcut,
though this can be confusing if other options are included.
\end{quote}

We could always redirect the output to a file
by adding \texttt{\textgreater{}\ shortest.txt} to the end of the pipeline,
thereby retaining our answer for later reference.

In practice,
most Unix users would create this pipeline step by step,
just as we have:
by starting with a single command and adding others one by one,
checking the output after each change.
The shell makes this easy
by letting us move up and down in our \gref{command history}{command\_history}
with the ↑ and ↓ keys.
We can also edit old commands to create new ones,
so a very common sequence is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Run a command and check its output.
\item
  Use ↑ to bring it up again.
\item
  Add the pipe symbol \texttt{\textbar{}} and another command to the end of the line.
\item
  Run the pipe and check its output.
\item
  Use ↑ to bring it up again.
\item
  And so on.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{bash-tools-stdio}{%
\section{How Pipes Work}\label{bash-tools-stdio}}

In order to use pipes and redirection effectively,
we need to know a little about how they work.
When a computer runs a program---any program---it creates a \gref{process}{process} in memory\index{process}
to hold the program's instructions and data.
Every process in Unix has an input channel called \gref{standard input}{stdin}\index{standard input}\index{stdin}
and an output channel called \gref{standard output}{stdout}.\index{standard output}\index{stdout}
(By now you may be surprised that their names are so memorable,
but don't worry:
most Unix programmers call them \enquote{stdin} and \enquote{stdout},
which are pronounced \enquote{stuh-Din} and \enquote{stuh-Dout}).

The shell is a program like any other,
and like any other,
it runs inside a process.
Under normal circumstances its standard input is connected to our keyboard
and its standard output to our screen,
so it reads what we type
and displays its output for us to see (Figure~\ref{fig:bash-tools-stdio}a).
When we tell the shell to run a program
it creates a new process
and temporarily reconnects the keyboard and stream
to that process's standard input and output (Figure~\ref{fig:bash-tools-stdio}b).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/bash-tools/standard-io} 

}

\caption{Standard I/O.}\label{fig:bash-tools-stdio}
\end{figure}

If we provide one or more files for the command to read,
as with \texttt{sort\ lengths.txt},
the program reads data from those files.
If we don't provide any filenames,
though,
the Unix convention is for the program to read from standard input.
We can test this by running \texttt{sort} on its own,
typing in a few lines of text,
and then pressing Ctrl+D to signal the end of input .
\texttt{sort} will then sort and print whatever we typed:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{sort}
\ExtensionTok{one}
\ExtensionTok{two}
\ExtensionTok{three}
\ExtensionTok{four}
\NormalTok{^}\ExtensionTok{D}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
four
one
three
two
\end{verbatim}

Redirection with \texttt{\textgreater{}} tells the shell to connect the program's standard output to a file
instead of the screen (Figure~\ref{fig:bash-tools-stdio}c).

When we create a pipe like \texttt{wc\ *.txt\ \textbar{}\ sort},
the shell creates one process for each command so that \texttt{wc} and \texttt{sort} will run simultaneously,
and then connects the standard output of \texttt{wc} directly to the standard input of \texttt{sort}
(Figure~\ref{fig:bash-tools-stdio}d).

\texttt{wc} doesn't know whether its output is going to the screen,
another program,
or to a file via \texttt{\textgreater{}}.
Equally,
\texttt{sort} doesn't know if its input is coming from the keyboard or another process;
it just knows that it has to read, sort, and print.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Why Isn't It Doing Anything?}

What happens if a command is supposed to process a file
but we don't give it a filename?
For example, what if we type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ -l}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

but don't type \texttt{*.txt} (or anything else) after the command?
Since \texttt{wc} doesn't have any filenames,
it assumes it is supposed to read from the keyboard,
so it waits for us to type in some data.
It doesn't tell us this:
it just sits and waits.

This mistake can be hard to spot,
particularly if we put the filename at the end of the pipeline:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ -l }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{sort}\NormalTok{ moby_dick.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In this case,
\texttt{sort} ignores standard input and reads the data in the file,
but \texttt{wc} still just sits there waiting for input.

If we make this mistake,
we can end the program by typing Ctrl+C.
We can also use this to interrupt programs that are taking a long time to run
or are trying to connect to a website that isn't responding.
\end{quote}

Just as we can redirect standard output with \texttt{\textgreater{}},
we can connect standard input to a file using \texttt{\textless{}}.\index{redirection (in Unix shell)}
In the case of a single file,
this has the same effect as providing the file's name to the command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc} \OperatorTok{<}\NormalTok{ moby_dick.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
    22331  215832 1276222
\end{verbatim}

If we try to use redirection with a wildcard,
though,
the shell \emph{doesn't} concatenate all of the matching files:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc} \OperatorTok{<}\NormalTok{ *.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
-bash: *.txt: ambiguous redirect
\end{verbatim}

It also doesn't print the error message to standard output,
which we can prove by redirecting:

\end{verbatim}

Instead,
every process has a second output channel called \gref{standard error}{stderr}
(or \gref{stderr}{stderr}).\index{standard error}\index{stderr}
Programs use it for error messages
so that their attempts to tell us something has gone wrong don't vanish silently into an output file.
There are ways to redirect standard error,
but doing so is almost always a bad idea.

\hypertarget{bash-tools-loops}{%
\section{Repeating Commands on Many Files}\label{bash-tools-loops}}

A loop is a way to repeat a set of commands for each item in a list.\index{loop (in Unix shell)}
We can use them to build complex workflows out of simple pieces,
and (like wildcards)
they reduce the typing we have to do and the number of mistakes we might make.

Let's suppose that we want to take a section out of each book
whose name starts with the letter \enquote{s} in the \texttt{data} directory.
More specifically,
suppose we want to get the first 8 lines of each book
\emph{after} the 9 lines of license information that appear at the start of the file.
If we only cared about one file,
we could write a pipeline to take the first 17 lines
and then take the last 8 of those:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 17 sense_and_sensibility.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{tail}\NormalTok{ -n 8}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

If we try to use a wildcard to select files,
we only get 8 lines of output,
not the 16 we expect:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$  }\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 17 s*.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{tail}\NormalTok{ -n 8}

As the output shows,
the loop runs our pipeline once for each file.
There is a lot going on here,
so we will break it down into pieces:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The keywords \texttt{for}, \texttt{in}, \texttt{do}, and \texttt{done} create the loop,
  and must always appear in that order.
\item
  \texttt{filename} is a variable just like a variable in R or Python.\index{variable (in Unix shell)}\index{shell variable}
  At any moment it contains a value,
  but that value can change over time.
\item
  The loop runs once for each item in the list.
  Each time it runs,
  it assigns the next item to the variable.
  In this case \texttt{filename} will be \texttt{sense\_and\_sensibility.txt}
  the first time around the loop
  and \texttt{sherlock\_holmes.txt} the second time.
\item
  The commands that the loop executes are called the \gref{body}{loop\_body} of the loop\index{loop (in Unix shell)!loop body}
  and appear between the keywords \texttt{do} and \texttt{done}.
  Those commands use the current value of the variable \texttt{filename},
  but to get it,
  we must put a dollar sign \texttt{\$} in front of the variable's name.
  If we forget and use \texttt{filename} instead of \texttt{\$filename},
  the shell will think that we are referring to a file
  that is actually called \texttt{filename}.
\item
  The shell prompt changes from \texttt{\$}
  to a \gref{continuation prompt}{continuation\_prompt} \texttt{\textgreater{}}
  as we type in our loop\index{continuation prompt}\index{prompt (in Unix shell)!continuation}
  to remind us that we haven't finished typing a complete command yet.
  We don't type the \texttt{\textgreater{}},
  just as we don't type the \texttt{\$}.
  The continuation prompt \texttt{\textgreater{}} has nothing to do with redirection;
  it's used because there are only so many punctuation symbols available.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Continuation Prompts May Differ Too}

As mentioned in Chapter~\ref{bash-basics},
there is variation in how different shells look and operate.
If you noticed the second, third, and fourth code lines
in your for loop were prefaced with \texttt{for},
it's not because you did something wrong!
That difference is one of the ways in which \texttt{zsh} differs from \texttt{bash}.
\end{quote}

It is very common to use a wildcard to select a set of files
and then loop over that set to run commands:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\KeywordTok{for} \ExtensionTok{filename}\NormalTok{ in s*.txt}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{do}
\OperatorTok{>}   \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 17 }\VariableTok{$filename} \KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{tail}\NormalTok{ -n 8}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{done}

\hypertarget{bash-tools-meaningless}{%
\section{Variable Names}\label{bash-tools-meaningless}}

We should always choose meaningful names for variables,
but we should remember that those names don't mean anything to the computer.
For example,
we have called our loop variable \texttt{filename}
to make its purpose clear to human readers,
but we could equally well write our loop as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\KeywordTok{for} \ExtensionTok{x}\NormalTok{ in s*.txt}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{do}
\OperatorTok{>}   \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 17 }\VariableTok{$x} \KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{tail}\NormalTok{ -n 8}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{done}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\KeywordTok{for} \ExtensionTok{username}\NormalTok{ in s*.txt}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{do}
\OperatorTok{>}   \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 17 }\VariableTok{$username} \KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{tail}\NormalTok{ -n 8}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{done}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\emph{Don't do this.}
Programs are only useful if people can understand them,
so meaningless names like \texttt{x} and misleading names like \texttt{username}
increase the odds of misunderstanding.

\hypertarget{bash-tools-history}{%
\section{Redoing Things}\label{bash-tools-history}}

Loops are useful if we know in advance what we want to repeat,
but we can also repeat commands that we have run recently.
One way is to use ↑ and ↓
to go up and down in our command history as described earlier.
Another is to use \texttt{history}\index{history (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix commands!history}
to get a list of the last few hundred commands we have run:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{history}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  551  wc -l *.txt | sort -n
  552  wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 3
  553  wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 1 > shortest.txt
\end{verbatim}

We can use an exclamation mark \texttt{!} followed by a number
to repeat a recent command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ !}\ExtensionTok{552}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ -l *.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{sort}\NormalTok{ -n }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 3}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
   3582 time_machine.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
\end{verbatim}

The shell prints the command it is going to re-run to standard error
before executing it,
so that (for example) \texttt{!572~\textgreater{}~results.txt}
puts the command's output in a file
\emph{without} also writing the command to the file.

Having an accurate record of the things we have done
and a simple way to repeat them
are two of the main reasons people use the Unix shell.
In fact,
being able to repeat history is such a powerful idea
that the shell gives us several ways to do it:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{!head} re-runs the most recent command starting with \texttt{head},
  while \texttt{!wc} re-runs the most recent starting with \texttt{wc}.
\item
  If we type Ctrl+R (for \textbf{r}everse search)
  the shell searches backward through its history for whatever we type next.
  If we don't like the first thing it finds,
  we can type Ctrl+R again to go further back.
\end{itemize}

If we use \texttt{history}, ↑, or Ctrl+R
we will quickly notice that loops don't have to be broken across lines.
Instead,
their parts can be separated with semi-colons:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\KeywordTok{for} \ExtensionTok{filename}\NormalTok{ in s*.txt }\KeywordTok{;} \KeywordTok{do} \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 17 }\VariableTok{$filename} \KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{tail}\NormalTok{ -n 8}\KeywordTok{;}
\KeywordTok{done}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This is fairly readable,
though it becomes more challenging if our for loop includes multiple commands.
For example,
we may choose to include the \texttt{echo} command,
which prints its arguments to the screen,
so we can keep track of progress or for debugging.
Compare this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\KeywordTok{for} \ExtensionTok{filename}\NormalTok{ in s*.txt}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{do}
\OperatorTok{>}   \BuiltInTok{echo} \VariableTok{$filename}
\OperatorTok{>}   \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 17 }\VariableTok{$filename} \KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{tail}\NormalTok{ -n 8}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{done}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

with this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\KeywordTok{for} \ExtensionTok{filename}\NormalTok{ in s*.txt}\KeywordTok{;} \KeywordTok{do} \BuiltInTok{echo} \VariableTok{$filename}\KeywordTok{;} \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 17 }\VariableTok{$filename} \KeywordTok{|}
  \FunctionTok{tail}\NormalTok{ -n 8}\KeywordTok{;} \KeywordTok{done}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Even experienced users have a tendency to (incorrectly)
put the semi-colon after \texttt{do} instead of before it.
If our loop contains multiple commands,
though,
the multi-line format is much easier to read and troubleshoot.
Note that (depending on the size of your shell window)
the format separated by semi-colons may be printed onto more than one line,
as shown in the previous code example.
You can tell whether code entered into your shell
is intended to be run as a single line based on the prompt:
both the original command prompt (\texttt{\$}) and the continuation prompt (\texttt{\textgreater{}})
indicate the code is on separate lines;
the absence of either in shell commands indicates it is a single line of code.

\hypertarget{bash-tools-autoname}{%
\section{Creating New Filenames Automatically}\label{bash-tools-autoname}}

Suppose we want to create a backup copy of each book whose name ends in \enquote{e}.
If we don't want to change the files' names,
we can do this with \texttt{cp}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ~/zipf}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mkdir}\NormalTok{ backup}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cp}\NormalTok{ data/*e.txt backup}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ backup}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
jane_eyre.txt  time_machine.txt
\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Warnings}

If you attempt to re-execute the code chunk above,
you'll end up with an error after the second line:

\begin{verbatim}
mkdir: backup: File exists
\end{verbatim}

This warning isn't necessarily a cause for alarm.
It lets you know that the command couldn't be completed,
but will not prevent you from proceeding.
\end{quote}

But what if we want to append the extension \texttt{.bak} to the files' names?
\texttt{cp} can do this for a single file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cp}\NormalTok{ data/time_machine.txt backup/time_machine.txt.bak}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

but not for all the files at once:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cp}\NormalTok{ data/*e.txt backup/*e.txt.bak}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
cp: target 'backup/*e.txt.bak' is not a directory
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{backup/*e.txt.bak} doesn't match anything---those files don't yet exist---so
after the shell expands the \texttt{*} wildcards,
what we are actually asking \texttt{cp} to do is:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cp}\NormalTok{ data/jane_eyre.txt data/time_machine.txt backup/*e.bak}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This doesn't work because \texttt{cp} only understands how to do two things:
copy a single file to create another file,
or copy a bunch of files into a directory.
If we give it more than two names as arguments,
it expects the last one to be a directory.
Since \texttt{backup/*e.bak} is not,
\texttt{cp} reports an error.

Instead,
let's use a loop to copy files to the backup directory
and append the \texttt{.bak} suffix:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ data}
\NormalTok{$ }\KeywordTok{for} \ExtensionTok{filename}\NormalTok{ in *e.txt}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{do}
\OperatorTok{>}   \FunctionTok{cp} \VariableTok{$filename}\NormalTok{ ../backup/}\VariableTok{$filename}\NormalTok{.bak}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{done}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ ../backup}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
jane_eyre.txt.bak  time_machine.txt.bak
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{bash-tools-summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{bash-tools-summary}}

\hypertarget{bash-tools-exercises}{%
\section{Exercises}\label{bash-tools-exercises}}

The exercises below involve creating and moving new files,
as well as considering hypothetical files.
Please note that if you create or move any files or directories in your Zipf's Law project,
you may want to reorganize your files following the outline at the beginning of the next chapter.
If you accidentally delete necessary files,
you can start with a fresh copy of the data files
by following the instructions in Section~\ref{getting-started-download-data}.

\hypertarget{bash-tools-ex-redirect-append}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{What does \texttt{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}} mean?}{What does \textgreater\textgreater{} mean?}}\label{bash-tools-ex-redirect-append}}

We have seen the use of \texttt{\textgreater{}}, but there is a similar operator \texttt{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}} which works slightly differently.
We'll learn about the differences between these two operators by printing some strings.
We can use the \texttt{echo} command to print strings e.g.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{echo}\NormalTok{ The echo command prints text}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
The echo command prints text
\end{verbatim}

Now test the commands below to reveal the difference between the two operators:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{echo}\NormalTok{ hello }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ testfile01.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{echo}\NormalTok{ hello }\OperatorTok{>>}\NormalTok{ testfile02.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Hint: Try executing each command twice in a row and then examining the output files.

\hypertarget{bash-tools-ex-uniq-adjacent}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Why does \texttt{uniq} only remove adjacent duplicates?}{Why does uniq only remove adjacent duplicates?}}\label{bash-tools-ex-uniq-adjacent}}

Consider a hypothetical file \texttt{genres.txt} containing the following data:

\begin{verbatim}
science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
science fiction
\end{verbatim}

Running the command \texttt{uniq\ genres.txt} produces:

\begin{verbatim}
science fiction

science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
\end{verbatim}

Why do you think \texttt{uniq} only removes \emph{adjacent} duplicated lines?

you combine with it in a pipe to remove all duplicated lines?

\hypertarget{bash-tools-ex-reading-pipes}{%
\subsection{Pipe reading comprehension}\label{bash-tools-ex-reading-pipes}}

Frankenstein,1818
Jane Eyre,1847
Wuthering Heights,1847
Moby Dick,1851
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,1892
The Time Machine,1895

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{bash-tools-ex-loop-dry-run}{%
\subsection{Doing a dry run}\label{bash-tools-ex-loop-dry-run}}

A loop is a way to do many things at once---or to make many mistakes at
once if it does the wrong thing. One way to check what a loop \emph{would} do
is to \texttt{echo} the commands it would run instead of actually running them.

Suppose we want to preview the commands the following loop will execute
without actually running those commands
(\texttt{analyze} is a hypothetical command):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\KeywordTok{for} \FunctionTok{file}\NormalTok{ in *.txt}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{do}
\OperatorTok{>}   \ExtensionTok{analyze} \VariableTok{$file} \OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ analyzed-}\VariableTok{$file}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{done}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

What is the difference between the two loops below,
and which one would we want to run?
(Note: The lines starting with \texttt{\#} are not code,
and are included for labelling purposes only;
we'll discuss this more in the next chapter)

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

Why do these two loops give different outputs?

How would the output differ from using this command instead?

Why would the following loop be preferable?

\begin{Shaded}

the last command in the file is the \texttt{history} command itself, i.e.,
the shell has added \texttt{history} to the command log before actually
running it. In fact, the shell \emph{always} adds commands to the log
before running them. Why do you think it does this?

There isn't a way things should be. There's just what happens, and what we do.

--- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}
\end{quote}

The previous chapters explained how we can use the command line
to do all of the things we can do with a GUI,
and how to combine commands in new ways using pipes and redirection.
This chapter extends those ideas to show
how we can create new tools by saving commands in files
and how to use a more powerful version of \gref{wildcards}{wildcard}\index{regular expression!relation to wildcard}
to extract data from files.

We'll be continuing to work in the \texttt{zipf} project,
which after the previous chapter should contain the following files:

\begin{verbatim}
zipf/

\textbf{Deleting Extra Files}

You may have additional files

\end{quote}

\hypertarget{bash-advanced-script}{%
\section{Creating New Commands}\label{bash-advanced-script}}

Loops let us run the same commands many times,
but we can go further and save commands in files
so that we can repeat complex operations with a few keystrokes.
For historical reasons
a file full of shell commands is usually called a \gref{shell script}{shell\_script},\index{shell script}
but it is really just another kind of program.

Let's start by creating a new directory for our runnable programs called \texttt{bin/},
consistent with the project structure described in Section~\ref{getting-started-organize}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ~/zipf}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mkdir}\NormalTok{ bin}
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ bin}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Edit a new file called \texttt{book\_summary.sh} to hold our shell script:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{nano}\NormalTok{ book_summary.sh}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and insert this line:

\begin{verbatim}
head -n 17 ../data/moby_dick.txt | tail -n 8
\end{verbatim}

Note that we do \emph{not} put the \texttt{\$} prompt at the front of the line.
We have been showing that to highlight interactive commands,
but in this case we are putting the command in a file rather than running it immediately.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Empty Line at the End of a File?}

You'll often see scripts from many languages that end in an empty line.
What you are seeing, though,
is the last line of code ending in a newline character.
This indicates to the computer that the code has ended.
While this newline character is not \emph{required} for shell scripts to work,
and sometimes isn't shown by coding tools,
it does make it easier to view and modify scripts.
When you are copying code from this book,
remember to add an empty line at the end!\index{whitespace}
\end{quote}

Once we have added this line,
we can save the file with Ctrl+O
and exit with Ctrl+X.
\texttt{ls} shows that our file now exists:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
book_summary.sh
\end{verbatim}

We can check the contents of the file using \texttt{cat\ book\_summary.sh}.
More importantly,
we can now ask the shell to run this file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{bash}\NormalTok{ book_summary.sh}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Title: Moby Dick
       or The Whale
Author: Herman Melville
Editor:
Release Date: December 25, 2008 [EBook #2701]
Posting Date:
Last Updated: December 3, 2017
Language: English
\end{verbatim}

Sure enough,
our script's output is exactly the same text we would get if we ran the command directly.
If we want,
we can pipe the output of our shell script to another command to count how many lines it contains:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{bash}\NormalTok{ book_summary.sh }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ -l}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
     8
\end{verbatim}

What if we want our script to print the name of the book's author?
The command \texttt{grep}\index{grep}\index{Unix commands!grep} finds and prints lines that match a pattern.
We'll learn more about \texttt{grep} in Section~\ref{bash-advanced-grep},
but for now we can edit the script:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{nano}\NormalTok{ book_summary.sh}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and add a search for the word \enquote{Author}:

\begin{verbatim}
head -n 17 ../data/moby_dick.txt | tail -n 8 | grep Author
\end{verbatim}

Sure enough,
when we run our modified script:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{bash}\NormalTok{ book_summary.sh}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

we get the line we want:

\begin{verbatim}
Author: Herman Melville
\end{verbatim}

And once again
we can pipe the output of our script into other commands
just as we would pipe the output from any other program.
Here,
we count the number of words in the author line:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{bash}\NormalTok{ book_summary.sh }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ -w}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
      3
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{bash-advanced-params}{%
\section{Making Scripts More Versatile}\label{bash-advanced-params}}

Getting the name of the author for only one of the books isn't particularly useful.
What we really want is a way to get the name of the author from any of our files.
Let's edit \texttt{book\_summary.sh} again
and replace \texttt{../data/moby\_dick.txt} with
a special variable \texttt{\$1}.\index{shell script!arguments}\index{\$1, \$2, etc. (in shell script)}\index{arguments (of shell script)}
Once our change is made,
\texttt{book\_summary.sh} should contain:

\begin{verbatim}
head -n 17 $1 | tail -n 8 | grep Author
\end{verbatim}

Inside a shell script,
\texttt{\$1} means \enquote{the first argument on the command line}.
If we now run our script like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{bash}\NormalTok{ book_summary.sh ../data/moby_dick.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

then \texttt{\$1} is assigned \texttt{../data/moby\_dick.txt}
and we get exactly the same output as before.
If we give the script a different filename:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$  }\FunctionTok{bash}\NormalTok{ book_summary.sh ../data/frankenstein.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

we get the name of the author of that book instead:

\begin{verbatim}
Author: Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley
\end{verbatim}

Our small script is now doing something useful,
but it may take the next person who reads it a moment to figure out exactly what.
We can improve our script by adding \gref{comments}{comment} at the top:\index{comments!in shell script}

\begin{verbatim}
# Get author information from a Project Gutenberg eBook.
# Usage: bash book_summary.sh /path/to/file.txt
head -n 17 $1 | tail -n 8 | grep Author
\end{verbatim}

As in R and Python,
a comment starts with a \texttt{\#} character and runs to the end of the line.
The computer ignores comments,
but they help people (including our future self) understand and use what we've created.

Let's make one more change to our script.
Instead of always extracting the author name,
let's have it select whatever information the user specified:

\begin{verbatim}
# Get desired information from a Project Gutenberg eBook.
# Usage: bash book_summary.sh /path/to/file.txt what_to_look_for
head -n 17 $1 | tail -n 8 | grep $2
\end{verbatim}

The change is very small:
we have replaced the fixed string \enquote{Author} with a reference to the special variable \texttt{\$2},
which is assigned the value of the second command-line argument we give the script when we run it.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Update Your Comments}

As you update the code in your script,
don't forget to update the comments that describe the code.
A description that sends readers in the wrong direction is worse than none at all,
so do your best to avoid this common oversight.
\end{quote}

Let's check that it works by asking for \emph{Frankenstein}'s release date:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{bash}\NormalTok{ book_summary.sh ../data/frankenstein.txt Release}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{bash-advanced-capture}{%
\section{Turning Interactive Work into a Script}\label{bash-advanced-capture}}

Suppose we have just run a series of commands that did something useful,
such as summarizing all books in a given directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\KeywordTok{for} \ExtensionTok{x}\NormalTok{ in ../data/*.txt}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{do}
\OperatorTok{>}   \BuiltInTok{echo} \VariableTok{$x}
\OperatorTok{>}   \FunctionTok{bash}\NormalTok{ book_summary.sh }\VariableTok{$x}\NormalTok{ Author}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{done} \OperatorTok{>} \ExtensionTok{authors.txt}
\NormalTok{$ }\KeywordTok{for} \ExtensionTok{x}\NormalTok{ in ../data/*.txt}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{do}
\OperatorTok{>}   \BuiltInTok{echo} \VariableTok{$x}
\OperatorTok{>}   \FunctionTok{bash}\NormalTok{ book_summary.sh }\VariableTok{$x}\NormalTok{ Release}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{done} \OperatorTok{>} \ExtensionTok{releases.txt}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
authors.txt        book_summary.sh      releases.txt
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mkdir}\NormalTok{ ../results}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mv}\NormalTok{ authors.txt releases.txt ../results}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Instead of typing those commands into a file in an editor
(and potentially getting them wrong)
we can use \texttt{history} and redirection to save recent commands to a file.\index{shell script!using history to create}
For example,
we can save the last six commands to \texttt{summarize\_all\_books.sh}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{history}\NormalTok{ 6 }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ summarize_all_books.sh}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cat}\NormalTok{ summarize_all_books.sh}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
297 for x in ../data/*.txt; do echo $x;
  bash book_summary.sh $x Author; done > authors.txt
298 for x in ../data/*.txt; do echo $x;
  bash book_summary.sh $x Release; done > releases.txt
299 ls
300 mkdir ../results
301 mv authors.txt releases.txt ../results
302 history 6 > summarize_all_books.sh
\end{verbatim}

We can now open the file in an editor,
remove the serial numbers at the start of each line,
and delete the lines we don't want
to create a script that captures exactly what we actually did.
This is how we usually develop shell scripts:
run commands interactively a few times to make sure they are doing the right thing,
then save our recent history to a file and turn that into a reusable script.

\hypertarget{bash-advanced-grep}{%
\section{Finding Things in Files}\label{bash-advanced-grep}}

We can use \texttt{head} and \texttt{tail} to select lines from a file by position,
but we also often want to select lines that contain certain values.
This is called \gref{filtering}{filter},\index{filter (in Unix shell)}
and we usually do it in the shell with the command \texttt{grep}\index{grep}\index{Unix commands!grep}
that we briefly met in Section~\ref{bash-advanced-script}.
Its name is an acronym of \enquote{global regular expression print},
which was a common sequence of operations in early Unix text editors.

To show how \texttt{grep} works,
we will use our sleuthing skills to explore \texttt{data/sherlock\_holmes.txt}.
First,
let's find lines that contain the word \enquote{Sherlock}.
Since there are likely to be hundreds of matches,
we will pipe \texttt{grep}'s output to \texttt{head} to show only the first few:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ~/zipf}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{grep}\NormalTok{ Sherlock data/sherlock_holmes.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here, \texttt{Sherlock} is our (very simple) pattern.
\texttt{grep} searches the file line by line
and shows those lines that contain matches,
so the output is:

\begin{verbatim}
Project Gutenberg's The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Arthur
Conan Doyle
Title: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description,
"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."
\end{verbatim}

If we run \texttt{grep\ sherlock} instead we get no output,
since \texttt{grep} patterns are case-sensitive.
If we wanted to make the search case-insensitive,
we can add the option \texttt{-i}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{grep}\NormalTok{ -i sherlock data/sherlock_holmes.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Project Gutenberg's The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Arthur
Conan Doyle
Title: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF
SHERLOCK HOLMES ***
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
\end{verbatim}

This output is different from our previous output
because of the lines containing \enquote{SHERLOCK} near the top of the file.

Next, let's search for the pattern \texttt{on}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{grep}\NormalTok{ on data/sherlock_holmes.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Conan Doyle
This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away
or with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net
Author: Arthur Conan Doyle
\end{verbatim}

In each of these lines,
our pattern (\enquote{on}) is part of a larger word such as \enquote{Conan}.
To restrict matching to lines containing \texttt{on} by itself,
we can give \texttt{grep} the \texttt{-w} option (for \enquote{match words}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{grep}\NormalTok{ -w on data/sherlock_holmes.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful
"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the
on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted
\end{verbatim}

What if we want to search for a phrase rather than a single word?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{grep}\NormalTok{ on the data/sherlock_holmes.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
grep: the: No such file or directory

  You may copy it, give it away or
data/sherlock_holmes.txt:with this eBook or online at
  www.gutenberg.net
data/sherlock_holmes.txt:Author: Arthur Conan Doyle
\end{verbatim}

In this case,
\texttt{grep} uses \texttt{on} as the pattern
and tries to find it in files called \texttt{the} and \texttt{data/sherlock\_holmes.txt}.
It then tells us that the file \texttt{the} cannot be found,
but prints \texttt{data/sherlock\_holmes.txt} as a prefix to each other line of output
to tell us which file those lines came from.
If we want to give \texttt{grep} both words as a single argument,
we must wrap them in quotation marks as before:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{grep} \StringTok{"on the"}\NormalTok{ data/sherlock_holmes.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was
drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the
on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted
pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Quoting}

Quotation marks aren't specific to \texttt{grep}:
the shell interprets them before running commands,
just as it expands wildcards to create filenames
no matter what command those filenames are being passed to.
This allows us to do things like \texttt{head\ -n\ 5\ "My\ Thesis.txt"}
to get lines from a file that has a space in its name.
It is also why many programmers write \texttt{"\$variable"} instead of just \texttt{\$variable}
when creating loops or shell scripts:
if there's any chance at all that the variable's value will contain spaces,
it's safest to put it in quotes.
\end{quote}

One of the most useful options for \texttt{grep} is \texttt{-n},
which numbers the lines that match the search:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{grep}\NormalTok{ -n }\StringTok{"on the"}\NormalTok{ data/sherlock_holmes.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
105:One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was
118:drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
155:"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the
165:on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted
198:pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{grep} has many options---so many,
in fact,
that almost every letter of the alphabet means something to it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{man}\NormalTok{ grep}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

We can combine options to \texttt{grep} as we do with other Unix commands.
For example,
we can combine two options we've covered previously with \texttt{-v}
to invert the match---i.e.,
to print lines that \emph{don't} match the pattern:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{grep}\NormalTok{ -i -n -v the data/sherlock_holmes.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
2:
4:almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or
6:with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net
7:
8:
\end{verbatim}

As we learned in Section~\ref{bash-basics-navigate},
we can write this command as \texttt{grep\ -inv},
but probably shouldn't for the sake of readability.

If we want to search several files at once,
all we have to do is give \texttt{grep} all of their names.
The easiest way to do this is usually to use wildcards.
For example,
this command counts how many lines contain \enquote{pain} in all of our books:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{grep}\NormalTok{ -w pain data/*.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ -l}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
     122
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively,
the \texttt{-r} option (for \enquote{recursive}) tells \texttt{grep} to search all of the files
in or below a directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{grep}\NormalTok{ -w -r pain data }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ -l}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
     122
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{grep} becomes even more powerful
when we start using \gref{regular expressions}{regular\_expression},\index{regular expression}
which are sets of letters, numbers, and symbols that define complex patterns.
For example,
this command finds lines that start with the letter \enquote{T}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{grep}\NormalTok{ -E }\StringTok{"^T"}\NormalTok{ data/sherlock_holmes.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
Title: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{-E} option tells \texttt{grep} to interpret the pattern as a regular expression,
rather than searching for an actual circumflex followed by an upper-case \enquote{T}.
The quotation marks prevent the shell from treating special characters in the pattern as wildcards,
and the \texttt{\^{}} means that a line only matches
if it begins with the search term---in this case, \texttt{T}.

Many tools support regular expressions:
we can use them in programming languages,
database queries,
online search engines,
and most text editors (though not Nano---its creators wanted to keep it as small as possible).
A detailed guide of regular expressions is outside the scope of this book,
but a wide range of tutorials are available online,
and Goyvaerts and Levithan (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Goyv2012}{2012}) is a useful companion if you need to go further.

\hypertarget{bash-advanced-find}{%
\section{Finding Files}\label{bash-advanced-find}}

While \texttt{grep} finds things in files,
the \texttt{find} command finds files themselves.\index{find}\index{Unix commands!find}
It also has a lot of options,
but unlike most Unix commands they are written as full words
rather than single-letter abbreviations.
To show how it works,
we will use the entire contents of our \texttt{zipf} directory,
including files we created earlier in this chapter:

\begin{verbatim}
zipf/
├── bin
│   ├── book_summary.sh
│   ├── summarize_all_books.sh
├── data
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── dracula.txt
│   ├── frankenstein.txt
│   ├── jane_eyre.txt
│   ├── moby_dick.txt
│   ├── sense_and_sensibility.txt
│   ├── sherlock_holmes.txt
│   └── time_machine.txt
└── results
    ├── authors.txt
    └── releases.txt
\end{verbatim}

For our first command,
let's run \texttt{find\ .} to find and list everything in this directory.
As always,
\texttt{.} on its own means the current working directory,
which is where we want our search to start.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ~/zipf}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{find}\NormalTok{ .}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
.
./bin
./bin/summarize_all_books.sh
./bin/book_summary.sh
./results
./results/releases.txt
./results/authors.txt
./data
./data/moby_dick.txt
./data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
./data/sherlock_holmes.txt
./data/time_machine.txt
./data/frankenstein.txt
./data/README.md
./data/dracula.txt
./data/jane_eyre.txt
\end{verbatim}

If we only want to find directories,
we can tell \texttt{find} to show us things of type \texttt{d}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{find}\NormalTok{ . -type d}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
.
./bin
./results
./data
\end{verbatim}

If we change \texttt{-type\ d} to \texttt{-type\ f}
we get a listing of all the files instead:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{find}\NormalTok{ . -type f}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
./bin/summarize_all_books.sh
./bin/book_summary.sh
./results/releases.txt
./results/authors.txt
./data/moby_dick.txt
./data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
./data/sherlock_holmes.txt
./data/time_machine.txt
./data/frankenstein.txt
./data/README.md
./data/dracula.txt
./data/jane_eyre.txt
\end{verbatim}

Now let's try matching by name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{find}\NormalTok{ . -name }\StringTok{"*.txt"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
./results/releases.txt
./results/authors.txt
./data/moby_dick.txt
./data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
./data/sherlock_holmes.txt
./data/time_machine.txt
./data/frankenstein.txt
./data/dracula.txt
./data/jane_eyre.txt
\end{verbatim}

Notice the quotes around \texttt{"*.txt"}.
If we omit them and type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{find}\NormalTok{ . -name *.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

then the shell tries to expand the \texttt{*} wildcard in \texttt{*.txt}
\emph{before} running \texttt{find}.
Since there aren't any text files in the current directory,
the expanded list is empty,
so the shell tries to run the equivalent of

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{find}\NormalTok{ . -name}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and gives us the error message:

\begin{verbatim}
find: -name: requires additional arguments
\end{verbatim}

We have seen before how to combine commands using pipes.
Let's use another technique to see how large our books are:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ -l }\VariableTok{$(}\FunctionTok{find}\NormalTok{ . -name }\StringTok{"*.txt"}\VariableTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
14 ./results/releases.txt
14 ./results/authors.txt
22331 ./data/moby_dick.txt
13028 ./data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
13053 ./data/sherlock_holmes.txt
3582 ./data/time_machine.txt
7832 ./data/frankenstein.txt
15975 ./data/dracula.txt
21054 ./data/jane_eyre.txt
96883 total
\end{verbatim}

When the shell executes our command,
it runs whatever is inside \texttt{\$(...)}\index{Unix shell!command expansion}\index{command expansion (in Unix shell)}\index{\$(...) in Unix shell}
and then replaces \texttt{\$(...)} with that command's output.
Since the output of \texttt{find} is the paths to our text files,
the shell constructs the command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{wc}\NormalTok{ -l ./results/releases.txt ... ./data/jane_eyre.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

(We are using \texttt{...} in place of seven files' names in order to fit things neatly on the printed page.)
This results in the output as seen above.
It is exactly like expanding the wildcard in \texttt{*.txt},
but more flexible.

We will often use \texttt{find} and \texttt{grep} together.
The first command finds files whose names match a pattern,
while the second looks for lines inside those files that match another pattern.
For example,
we can look for \texttt{Authors} in all our text files:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{grep} \StringTok{"Author:"} \VariableTok{$(}\FunctionTok{find}\NormalTok{ . -name }\StringTok{"*.txt"}\VariableTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
./results/authors.txt:Author: Bram Stoker
./results/authors.txt:Author: Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley
./results/authors.txt:Author: Charlotte Bronte
./results/authors.txt:Author: Herman Melville
./results/authors.txt:Author: Jane Austen
./results/authors.txt:Author: Arthur Conan Doyle

./data/frankenstein.txt:Author: Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley
./data/dracula.txt:Author: Bram Stoker
./data/jane_eyre.txt:Author: Charlotte Bronte
\end{verbatim}

We can also use \texttt{\$(...)} expansion to create a list of filenames to use in a loop:\index{loop (in Unix shell)!using command expansion}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\KeywordTok{for} \FunctionTok{file}\NormalTok{ in }\VariableTok{$(}\FunctionTok{find}\NormalTok{ . -name }\StringTok{"*.txt"}\VariableTok{)}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{do}
\OperatorTok{>} \FunctionTok{cp} \VariableTok{$file} \VariableTok{$file}\NormalTok{.bak}
\OperatorTok{>} \KeywordTok{done}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{find}\NormalTok{ . -name }\StringTok{"*.bak"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{bash-advanced-vars}{%
\section{Configuring the Shell}\label{bash-advanced-vars}}

As Section~\ref{bash-tools-loops} explained,
the shell is a program,
and like any other program it has variables.
Some of those variables control the shell's operations;
by changing their values
we can change how the shell and other programs behave.

Let's run the command \texttt{set}\index{set (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix commands!set}
and look at some of the variables the shell defines:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\KeywordTok{set}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
COMPUTERNAME=TURING
HOME=/Users/amira
HOMEDRIVE=C:
HOSTNAME=TURING
HOSTTYPE=i686
NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS=4
OS=Windows_NT
PATH=/Users/amira/opt/anaconda3/bin:/usr/bin:
  /bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin
PWD=/Users/amira
UID=1000
USERNAME=amira
...
\end{verbatim}

There are many more than are shown here---roughly a hundred
in our current shell session.
And yes,
using \texttt{set} to \emph{show} things might seem a little strange,
even for Unix,
but if we don't give it any arguments,
the command might as well show us things we \emph{could} set.

By convention,
\gref{shell variables}{shell\_variable}\index{variable (in Unix shell)}\index{shell variable} that are always present have upper-case names.
All shell variables' values are strings,
even those (such as \texttt{UID}) that look like numbers.
It's up to programs to convert these strings to other types when necessary.
For example,
if a program wanted to find out how many processors the computer had,
it would convert the value of \texttt{NUMBER\_OF\_PROCESSORS} from a string to an integer.

Similarly, some variables (like \texttt{PATH}) store lists of values.\index{PATH variable (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix shell!PATH variable}
In this case, the convention is to use a colon \enquote{:} as a separator.
If a program wants the individual elements of such a list,
it must split the variable's value into pieces.

Let's have a closer look at \texttt{PATH}.
Its value defines the shell's \gref{search path}{search\_path},
which is the list of directories that the shell looks in for programs
when we type in a command name without specifying exactly where it is.
For example,
when we type a command like \texttt{analyze},
the shell needs to decide whether to run \texttt{./analyze} (in our current directory)
or \texttt{/bin/analyze} (in a system directory).
To do this,
the shell checks each directory in the \texttt{PATH} variable in turn.
As soon as it finds a program with the right name,
it stops searching and runs what it has found.

To show how this works,
here are the components of \texttt{PATH} listed one per line:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{/Users/amira/opt/anaconda3/bin}
\ExtensionTok{/usr/bin}
\ExtensionTok{/bin}
\ExtensionTok{/usr/sbin}
\ExtensionTok{/sbin}
\ExtensionTok{/usr/local/bin}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Suppose that our computer has three programs called \texttt{analyze}:
\texttt{/bin/analyze},
\texttt{/usr/local/bin/analyze},
and \texttt{/Users/amira/analyze}.
Since the shell searches the directories in the order they're listed in \texttt{PATH},
it finds \texttt{/bin/analyze} first and runs that.
Since \texttt{/Users/amira} is not in our path,
Bash will \emph{never} find the program \texttt{/Users/amira/analyze}
unless we type the path in explicitly
(for example,
as \texttt{./analyze} if we are in \texttt{/Users/amira}).

If we want to see a variable's value,
we can print it using the \texttt{echo} command
introduced at the end of Section~\ref{bash-tools-history}.
Let's look at the value of the variable \texttt{HOME},\index{HOME variable (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix shell!HOME variable}
which keeps track of our home directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{echo}\NormalTok{ HOME}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
HOME
\end{verbatim}

Whoops: this just prints \enquote{HOME}, which isn't what we wanted.
Instead,
we need to run this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{echo} \VariableTok{$HOME}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
/Users/amira
\end{verbatim}

As with loop variables (Section~\ref{bash-tools-loops}),
the dollar sign before the variable names tells the shell
that we want the variable's value.
This works just like wildcard expansion---the shell replaces
the variable's name with its value \emph{before} running the command we've asked for.
Thus,
\texttt{echo\ \$HOME} becomes \texttt{echo\ /Users/amira},
which displays the right thing.

Creating a variable is easy:\index{shell variable!creating}
we assign a value to a name using \enquote{=},
putting quotes around the value if it contains spaces or special characters:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\VariableTok{DEPARTMENT=}\StringTok{"Library Science"}
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{echo} \VariableTok{$DEPARTMENT}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Library Science
\end{verbatim}

To change the value, we simply assign a new one:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\VariableTok{DEPARTMENT=}\StringTok{"Information Science"}
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{echo} \VariableTok{$DEPARTMENT}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Information Science
\end{verbatim}

If we want to set some variables automatically every time we run a shell,
we can put commands to do this in a file called \texttt{.bashrc} in our home directory.\index{.bashrc file (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix shell!.bashrc file}
For example,
here are two lines in \texttt{/Users/amira/.bashrc}:

\begin{verbatim}
export DEPARTMENT="Library Science"
export TEMP_DIR=/tmp
export BACKUP_DIR=$TEMP_DIR/backup
\end{verbatim}

These three lines create the variables \texttt{DEPARTMENT},
\texttt{TEMP\_DIR},
and \texttt{BACKUP\_DIR},
and \gref{export}{export\_variable}\index{shell variable!exporting} them so that any programs the shell runs can see them as well.
Notice that \texttt{BACKUP\_DIR}'s definition relies on the value of \texttt{TEMP\_DIR},
so that if we change where we put temporary files,
our backups will be relocated automatically.
However,
this will only happen once we restart the shell,
because \texttt{.bashrc} is only executed when the shell starts up.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{What's in a Name?}

The \enquote{.} character at the front of the name \texttt{.bashrc}
prevents \texttt{ls} from listing this file
unless we specifically ask it to using \texttt{-a}.
The \enquote{rc} at the end is an abbreviation for \enquote{run commands},
which meant something really important decades ago,
and is now just a convention everyone follows without understanding why.
\end{quote}

While we're here,
it's also common to use the \texttt{alias} command\index{Unix commands!alias}\index{alias (Unix command)}
to create shortcuts for things we frequently type.
For example,
we can define the alias \texttt{backup}
to run \texttt{/bin/zback} with a specific set of arguments:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{alias}\NormalTok{ backup=/bin/zback -v --nostir -R 20000 }\VariableTok{$HOME} \VariableTok{$BACKUP_DIR}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Aliases can save us a lot of typing, and hence a lot of typing mistakes.
The name of an alias can be the same as an existing command,
so we can use them to change the behavior of a familiar command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Long list format including hidden files}
\BuiltInTok{alias}\NormalTok{ ls=}\StringTok{'ls -la'}

\CommentTok{# Print the file paths that were copied/moved}
\BuiltInTok{alias}\NormalTok{ mv=}\StringTok{'mv -v'}
\BuiltInTok{alias}\NormalTok{ cp=}\StringTok{'cp -v'}

\CommentTok{# Request confirmation to remove a file and}
\CommentTok{# print the file path that is removed}
\BuiltInTok{alias}\NormalTok{ rm=}\StringTok{'rm -iv'}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can find interesting suggestions for other aliases
by searching online for \enquote{sample bashrc}.

While searching for additional aliases,
you're likely to encounter references to other common shell features to customize,
such as the color of your shell's background and text.
As mentioned in Chapter~\ref{bash-basics},
another important feature to consider customizing is your shell prompt.\index{prompt (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix shell!prompt}
In addition to a standard symbol (like \texttt{\$}),
your computer may include other information as well,
such as the working directory, username, and/or date/time.
If your shell does not include that information and you would like to see it,
or if your current prompt is too long and you'd like to shorten it,
you can include a line in your \texttt{.bashrc} file that defines \texttt{\$PS1}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\VariableTok{PS1=}\StringTok{"\textbackslash{}u \textbackslash{}w $ "}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This changes the prompt to include your username and current working directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{amira}\NormalTok{ ~/Desktop $}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{bash-advanced-summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{bash-advanced-summary}}

As powerful as the Unix shell is,
it does have its shortcomings:
dollar signs, quotes, and other punctuation
can make a complex shell script look as though
it was created by a cat dancing on a keyboard.
However,
it is the glue that holds data science together:
shell scripts are used to create pipelines from miscellaneous sets of programs,
while shell variables are used to do everything from
specifying package installation directories to managing database login credentials.
And while \texttt{grep} and \texttt{find} may take some getting used to,
they and their cousins can handle enormous datasets very efficiently.
If you would like to go further,
Ray and Ray (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ray2014}{2014}) is an excellent general introduction,
while Janssens (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jans2014}{2014}) looks specifically at how to process data on the command line.

As we have gone through this chapter,
we have created several files that we won't need again.
We can clean them up with the following commands;
briefly explain what each line does.

\begin{Shaded}

\hypertarget{bash-advanced-ex-script-variables}{%

\FunctionTok{tail}\NormalTok{ -n }\VariableTok{$3} \VariableTok{$1}

With this script in your \texttt{data} directory, you type the following command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{bash}\NormalTok{ script.sh }\StringTok{'*.txt'}\NormalTok{ 1 1}

with that extension. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{bash}\NormalTok{ longest.sh data/ txt}

Your friend thinks that the elder of the two Dashwood sisters,
Elinor,

Luckily, \texttt{sense\_and\_sensibility.txt} contains the full text of the novel.

Multiple exclamation marks are a sure sign of a diseased mind.

--- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}
\end{quote}

The \href{https://jupyter.org/}{Jupyter Notebook}, PyCharm, and other graphical interfaces
are great for prototyping code and exploring data,
but eventually we may need to apply our code to thousands of data files,
run it with many different parameters,
or combine it with other programs as part of a data analysis pipeline.
The easiest way to do this is often
to turn our code into a standalone program that can be run in the Unix shell
just like other command-line tools (Taschuk and Wilson \protect\hyperlink{ref-Tasc2017}{2017}).

In this chapter we will develop some command-line Python programs\index{Python!command line}
that handle input and output in the same way as other shell commands,
can be controlled by several option flags,
and provide useful information when things go wrong.
The result will have more scaffolding than useful application code,
but that scaffolding stays more or less the same as programs get larger.

After the previous chapters,
our Zipf's Law project should have the following files and directories:

\begin{verbatim}

\textbf{Python Style}

When writing Python code there are many style choices to make.
How many spaces should I put between functions?
Should I use capital letters in variable names?
How should I order all the different elements of a Python script?
Fortunately,
there are well established conventions and guidelines
for good Python style.
We follow those guidelines throughout this book
and discuss them in detail in Appendix \ref{style}.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{scripting-main}{%
\section{Programs and Modules}\label{scripting-main}}

To create a Python program that can run from the command line,\index{Python!program vs.\ module}
the first thing we do is to add the following to the bottom of the file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if} \VariableTok{__name__} \OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{'__main__'}\NormalTok{:}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This strange-looking check tells us
whether the file is running as a standalone program
or whether it is being imported as a module by some other program.
When we import a Python file as a module in another program,
the \texttt{\_\_name\_\_} variable is automatically set to the name of the file.\index{\_\_name\_\_ variable (in Python)}\index{Python!\_\_name\_\_ variable}
When we run a Python file as a standalone program,
on the other hand,
\texttt{\_\_name\_\_} is always set to the special string \texttt{"\_\_main\_\_"}.
To illustrate this,
let's consider a script named \texttt{print\_name.py}
that prints the value of the \texttt{\_\_name\_\_} variable:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\VariableTok{__name__}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When we run this file directly,
it will print \texttt{\_\_main\_\_}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ print_name.py}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
__main__
\end{verbatim}

But if we import \texttt{print\_name.py} from another file
or from the Python interpreter,
it will print the name of the file,
i.e.~\texttt{print\_name}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Python 3.8.1 | packaged by conda-forge |
(default, Jan 29 2020, 14:55:04)
[GCC 7.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license"
for more information.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OperatorTok{>>>} \ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ print_name}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
print_name
\end{verbatim}

Checking the value of the variable \texttt{\_\_name\_\_}
therefore tells us whether our file is the top-level program or not.
If it is,
we can handle command-line options, print help, or whatever else is appropriate;
if it isn't,
we should assume that some other code is doing this.

We could put the main program code directly under the \texttt{if} statement like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if} \VariableTok{__name__} \OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{"__main__"}\NormalTok{:}
    \CommentTok{# code goes here}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

but that is considered poor practice,
since it makes testing harder (Chapter~\ref{testing}).
Instead,
we put the high-level logic in a function,
then call that function if our file is being run directly:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ main():}
    \CommentTok{# code goes here}


\ControlFlowTok{if} \VariableTok{__name__} \OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{"__main__"}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{    main()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This top-level function is usually called \texttt{main},
but we can use whatever name we want.

\hypertarget{scripting-options}{%
\section{Handling Command-Line Options}\label{scripting-options}}

The main function in a program usually starts by
parsing any options the user gave on the command line.\index{option (of Python program)}\index{Python!option}
The most commonly used library for doing this in Python is \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html}{\texttt{argparse}},
which can handle options with or without arguments,
convert arguments from strings to numbers or other types,
display help,
and many other things.

The simplest way to explain how \texttt{argparse} works is by example.
Let's create a short Python program called \texttt{script\_template.py}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ argparse}


\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ main(args):}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'Input file:'}\NormalTok{, args.infile)}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'Output file:'}\NormalTok{, args.outfile)}


\ControlFlowTok{if} \VariableTok{__name__} \OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{'__main__'}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{    USAGE }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{'One-line description of what the script does.'}
\NormalTok{    parser }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ argparse.ArgumentParser(description}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{USAGE)}
\NormalTok{    parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'infile'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{str}\NormalTok{,}
                        \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Input file name'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{    parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'outfile'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{str}\NormalTok{,}
                        \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Output file name'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{    args }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ parser.parse_args()}
\NormalTok{    main(args)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Empty Lines, Again}

As we discussed in the last chapter for shell scripts,
remember to end your Python scripts in a newline character
(which we view as an empty line).\index{whitespace}
\end{quote}

If \texttt{script\_template.py} is run as a standalone program at the command line
then \texttt{\_\_name\_\_\ ==\ \textquotesingle{}\_\_main\_\_\textquotesingle{}} is true,
so the program uses \texttt{argparse} to create an argument parser.
It then specifies that it expects two command-line arguments:
an input filename (\texttt{infile}) and output filename (\texttt{outfile}).
The program uses \texttt{parser.parse\_args()} to parse the actual command-line arguments given by the user
and stores the result in a variable called \texttt{args},
which it passes to \texttt{main}.
That function can then get the values using the names specified
in the \texttt{parser.add\_argument} calls.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Specifying Types}

We have passed \texttt{type=str} to \texttt{add\_argument} to tell \texttt{argparse} that
we want \texttt{infile} and \texttt{outfile} to be treated as strings.
\texttt{str} is not quoted because it is not a string itself:
instead,
it is the built-in Python function that converts things to strings.
As we will see below,
we can pass in other functions like \texttt{int}
if we want arguments converted to numbers.
\end{quote}

If we run \texttt{script\_template.py} at the command line
the output shows us that \texttt{argparse} has successfully handled the arguments:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ script_template.py in.csv out.png}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Input file: in.csv
Output file: out.png
\end{verbatim}

It also displays an error message if we give the program invalid arguments:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ script_template.py in.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
usage: script_template.py [-h] infile outfile
script_template.py: error: the following arguments are
  required: outfile
\end{verbatim}

Finally,
it automatically generates help information
(which we can get using the \texttt{-h} option):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ script_template.py -h}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
usage: script_template.py [-h] infile outfile

One-line description of what the script does.

positional arguments:
  infile      Input file name
  outfile     Output file name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{scripting-docstrings}{%
\section{Documentation}\label{scripting-docstrings}}

Our program template is a good starting point,
but we improve it right away
by adding a bit of documentation.\index{Python!documenting}
To demonstrate,
let's write a function that doubles a number:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ double(num):}
    \CommentTok{'Double the input.'}
    \ControlFlowTok{return} \DecValTok{2} \OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{ num}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The first line of this function is a string
that isn't assigned to a variable.
Such a string is called a documentation string,
or \gref{docstring}{docstring} for short.\index{docstring (in Python)}\index{Python!docstring}
If we call our function it does what we expect:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{double(}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
6
\end{verbatim}

However,
we can also ask for the function's documentation,
which is stored in \texttt{double.\_\_doc\_\_}:\index{\_\_doc\_\_ variable (in Python)}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{double.__doc__}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
'Double the input.'
\end{verbatim}

Python creates the variable \texttt{\_\_doc\_\_} automatically for every function,
just as it creates the variable \texttt{\_\_name\_\_} for every file.
If we don't write a docstring for a function,
\texttt{\_\_doc\_\_}'s value is an empty string.
We can put whatever text we want into a function's docstring,
but it is usually used to provide online documentation.

We can also put a docstring at the start of a file,
in which case it is assigned to a variable called \texttt{\_\_doc\_\_}
that is visible inside the file.
If we add documentation to our template,
it becomes:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{"""One-line description of what the script does."""}

\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ argparse}


\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ main(args):}
    \CommentTok{"""Run the program."""}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'Input file:'}\NormalTok{, args.infile)}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'Output file:'}\NormalTok{, args.outfile)}


\ControlFlowTok{if} \VariableTok{__name__} \OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{'__main__'}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{    parser }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ argparse.ArgumentParser(description}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{__doc__)}
\NormalTok{    parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'infile'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{str}\NormalTok{,}
                        \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Input file name'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{    parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'outfile'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{str}\NormalTok{,}
                        \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Output file name'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{    args }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ parser.parse_args()}
\NormalTok{    main(args)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that docstrings are usually written using triple-quoted strings,\index{Python!triple-quoted strings}
since these can span multiple lines.
Note also how we pass \texttt{description=\_\_doc\_\_} to \texttt{argparse.ArgumentParser}.
This saves us from typing the same information twice,
but more importantly ensures that
the help message provided in response to the \texttt{-h} option
will be the same as the interactive help.

Let's try this out in an interactive Python session.
(Remember, do not type the \texttt{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}\textgreater{}} prompt:
Python provides this for us.)

As this example shows,
if we ask for help on the module,
Python formats and displays all of the docstrings for everything in the file.
We talk more about what to put in a docstring in Appendix~\ref{documentation}.

\hypertarget{scripting-wordcount}{%
\section{Counting Words}\label{scripting-wordcount}}

Now that we have a template for command-line Python programs,
we can use it to check Zipf's Law for our collection of classic novels.
We start by moving the template into the directory
where we store our runnable programs (Section~\ref{getting-started-organize}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mv}\NormalTok{ script_template.py ~/zipf/bin}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Next,
let's write a function that counts how often words appear in a file.
Our function splits the text on \gref{whitespace}{whitespace} characters
(which is the default behavior of the string object's \texttt{split} method),
then strips leading and trailing punctuation.
This isn't completely correct---if two words are joined by a long dash
like \enquote{correct} and \enquote{if} in this sentence, for example,
they will be treated as one word---but given that long dashes are used relatively
infrequently it's close enough to correct for our purposes.
(We will submit a bug report about the long dash issue in Section~\ref{teams-bugs}).
We also use the \texttt{Counter} class from the \texttt{collections} library
to count how many times each word occurs.
If we give \texttt{Counter} a list of words,
the result is an object that contains
the number of times each one appears in the list:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ string}
\ImportTok{from}\NormalTok{ collections }\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ Counter}


\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ count_words(reader):}
    \CommentTok{"""Count the occurrence of each word in a string."""}
\NormalTok{    text }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ reader.read()}
\NormalTok{    chunks }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ text.split()}
\NormalTok{    stripped }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [word.strip(string.punctuation) }\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ word }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ chunks]}
\NormalTok{    word_list }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [word.lower() }\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ word }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ stripped }\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ word]}
\NormalTok{    word_counts }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ Counter(word_list)}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ word_counts}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's try our function on \emph{Dracula}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{with} \BuiltInTok{open}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'data/dracula.txt'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'r'}\NormalTok{) }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ reader:}
\NormalTok{    word_counts }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ count_words(reader)}
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(word_counts)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Counter({'the': 8036, 'and': 5896, 'i': 4712, 'to': 4540,
         'of': 3738, 'a': 2961, 'in': 2558, 'he': 2543,
         'that': 2455, 'it': 2141, 'was': 1877, 'as': 1581,
         'we': 1535, 'for': 1534, ...})
\end{verbatim}

If we want the word counts in a format like CSV for easier processing,
we can write another small function that takes our \texttt{Counter} object,
orders its contents from most to least frequent,
and then writes it to \gref{standard output}{stdout} as CSV:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ csv}


\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ collection_to_csv(collection):}
    \CommentTok{"""Write out collection of items and counts in csv format."""}
\NormalTok{    collection }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ collection.most_common()}
\NormalTok{    writer }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ csv.writer(sys.stdout)}
\NormalTok{    writer.writerows(collection)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Running this would print all the distinct words in the book
along with their counts.
This list could well be several thousand lines long,
so to make the output a little easier to view on our screen,
we can add an option to limit the output to the most frequent words.
We set its default value to \texttt{None}
so that we can easily tell if the caller \emph{hasn't} specified a cutoff,
in which case we display the whole collection:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ collection_to_csv(collection, num}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{None}\NormalTok{):}
    \CommentTok{"""Write out collection of items and counts in csv format."""}
\NormalTok{    collection }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ collection.most_common()}
    \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ num }\KeywordTok{is} \VariableTok{None}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{        num }\OperatorTok{=} \BuiltInTok{len}\NormalTok{(collection)}
\NormalTok{    writer }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ csv.writer(sys.stdout)}
\NormalTok{    writer.writerows(collection[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{:num])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{collection_to_csv(word_counts, num}\OperatorTok{=}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

to,4540
of,3738

he,2543
that,2455
it,2141
\end{verbatim}

To make our \texttt{count\_words} and \texttt{collection\_to\_csv} functions available at the command line,
we need to insert them into our script template
and call them from within the \texttt{main} function.
Let's call our program \texttt{countwords.py}
and put it in the \texttt{bin} subdirectory of the \texttt{zipf} project:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

Note that we have replaced the \texttt{\textquotesingle{}outfile\textquotesingle{}} argument from our template script
with an optional \texttt{-n} (or \texttt{-\/-num}) flag to control how much output is printed
and modified \texttt{collection\_to\_csv} so that it always prints to standard output.
If we want that output in a file,
we can redirect with \texttt{\textgreater{}}.

Let's take our program for a test drive:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\hypertarget{scripting-pipeline}{%
\section{Pipelining}\label{scripting-pipeline}}

As discussed in Section~\ref{bash-tools-stdio},
most Unix commands follow a useful convention:
if the user doesn't specify the names of any input files,
they read from \gref{standard input}{stdin}.\index{standard input!in Python}
Similarly,
if no output file is specified,
the command sends its results to \gref{standard output}{stdout}.
This makes it easy to use the command in a pipeline.

Our program always sends its output to standard output;\index{standard output!in Python}
as noted above,
we can always redirect it to a file with \texttt{\textgreater{}}.
If we want \texttt{countwords.py} to read from standard input,
we only need to change the handling of \texttt{infile} in the argument parser
and simplify \texttt{main} to match:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ main(args):}
    \CommentTok{"""Run the command line program."""}
\NormalTok{    word_counts }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ count_words(args.infile)}
\NormalTok{    collection_to_csv(word_counts, num}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{args.num)}


\ControlFlowTok{if} \VariableTok{__name__} \OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{'__main__'}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{    parser }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ argparse.ArgumentParser(description}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{__doc__)}
\NormalTok{    parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'infile'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{argparse.FileType(}\StringTok{'r'}\NormalTok{),}
\NormalTok{                        nargs}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'?'}\NormalTok{, default}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'-'}\NormalTok{,}
                        \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Input file name'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{    parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'-n'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'--num'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{int}\NormalTok{, default}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{None}\NormalTok{,}
                        \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Output only n most frequent words'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{    args }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ parser.parse_args()}
\NormalTok{    main(args)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There are two changes to how \texttt{add\_argument} handles \texttt{infile}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Setting \texttt{type=argparse.FileType(\textquotesingle{}r\textquotesingle{})}
  tells \texttt{argparse} to treat the argument as a filename
  and open that file for reading.
  This is why we no longer need to call \texttt{open} ourselves,
  and why \texttt{main} can pass \texttt{args.infile} directly to \texttt{count\_words}.
\item
  The number of expected arguments (\texttt{nargs}) is set to \texttt{?}.
  This means that if an argument is given it will be used,
  but if none is provided,
  a default of \texttt{\textquotesingle{}-\textquotesingle{}} will be used instead.
  \texttt{argparse.FileType(\textquotesingle{}r\textquotesingle{})} understands \texttt{\textquotesingle{}-\textquotesingle{}} to mean \enquote{read from standard input};
  this is another Unix convention that many programs follow.
\end{enumerate}

After these changes,
we can create a pipeline like this
to count the words in the first 500 lines of a book:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 500 data/dracula.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/countwords.py --n 10}

\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{scripting-positional-optional}{%
\section{Positional and Optional Arguments}\label{scripting-positional-optional}}

We have met two kinds of command-line arguments while writing \texttt{countwords.py}.
\gref{Optional arguments}{optional\_argument}\index{option (of shell command)!optional}
are defined using a leading \texttt{-} or \texttt{-\/-} (or both),
which means that all three of the following definitions are valid:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'-n'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{int}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Limit output'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'--num'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{int}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Limit output'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'-n'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'--num'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{int}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Limit output'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The convention is for \texttt{-} to precede
a \gref{short}{short\_option} (single letter) option\index{option (of shell command)!short}
and \texttt{-\/-} a \gref{long}{long\_option} (multi-letter) option.\index{option (of shell command)!long}
The user can provide optional arguments at the command line in any order they like.

\gref{Positional arguments}{positional\_argument}\index{positional argument (of program)}
have no leading dashes and are not optional:
the user must provide them at the command line
in the order in which they are specified to \texttt{add\_argument}
(unless \texttt{nargs=\textquotesingle{}?\textquotesingle{}} is provided to say that the value is optional).

\hypertarget{scripting-collate}{%
\section{Collating Results}\label{scripting-collate}}

Ultimately,
we want to save the word counts to a CSV file for further analysis and plotting.
Let's create a subdirectory to hold our results
(following the structure described in Section~\ref{getting-started-structure}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mkdir}\NormalTok{ results}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and then save the counts for various files:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/countwords.py data/dracula.txt }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ results/dracula.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/countwords.py data/moby_dick.txt }\OperatorTok{>}
  \ExtensionTok{results/moby_dick.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt }\OperatorTok{>}
  \ExtensionTok{results/jane_eyre.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As in the previous chapter,
we've split long lines of to code onto separate lines for formatting purposes;
each of the three code chunks above should be run as a single line of code.

Now that we can get word counts for individual books
we can collate the counts for several books.
This can be done using a loop that adds up the counts of a word
from the each of the CSV files created by \texttt{countwords.py}.
Using the same template as before,
we can write a program called \texttt{collate.py}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\NormalTok{    args }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ parser.parse_args()}
\NormalTok{    main(args)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The loop in the \texttt{main} function iterates over each filename in \texttt{infiles},
opens the CSV file,
and calls \texttt{update\_counts} with the input stream as one parameter
and the counter as the other.
\texttt{update\_counts} then iterates through all the words the CSV-files
and increments the counts using the \texttt{+=} operator.

Note that we have not used \texttt{type=argparse.FileType(\textquotesingle{}r\textquotesingle{})} here.
Instead,
we have called the option \texttt{infiles} (plural)
and specified \texttt{nargs=\textquotesingle{}*\textquotesingle{}}
to tell \texttt{argparse} that we will accept zero or more filenames.
We must then open the files ourselves.

Let's give \texttt{collate.py} a try
(using \texttt{-n\ 10} to limit the number of lines of output):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/collate.py results/dracula.csv}

\hypertarget{scripting-modules}{%
\section{Writing Our Own Modules}\label{scripting-modules}}

\texttt{countwords.py} and \texttt{collate.py} both now contain the function \texttt{collection\_to\_csv}.
Having the same function in two or more places is a bad idea:
if we want to improve it or fix a bug,
we have to find and change every single script that contains a copy.

The solution is to put the shared functions in a separate file
and load that file as a module.\index{Python!module}\index{module (in Python)}
Let's create a file called \texttt{utilities.py} in the \texttt{bin} directory
that looks like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{"""Collection of commonly used functions."""}

\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ sys}

\NormalTok{    writer.writerows(collection[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{:num])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that we have written a much more detailed docstring for \texttt{collection\_to\_csv}:
as a rule,
the more widely used code is,
the more it's worth explaining exactly what it does.

We can now import our utilities into our programs
just as we would import any other Python module
using either \texttt{import\ utilities} (to get the whole thing)
or something like \texttt{from\ utilities\ import\ collection\_to\_csv} (to get a single function).

\texttt{countwords.py} looks like this:

Any Python source file can be imported by any other.
This is why Python files should be named using \gref{snake case}{snake\_case}\index{snake case}\index{naming conventions!snake case}
(e.g.~\texttt{some\_thing})
instead of \gref{kebab case}{kebab\_case}\index{kebab case}\index{naming conventions!kebab case}
(e.g.~\texttt{some-thing}):
an expression like \texttt{import\ some-thing} isn't allowed
because \texttt{some-thing} isn't a legal variable name.
When a file is imported,
the statements in it are executed as it loads.
Variables, functions, and items defined in the file are then available as \texttt{module.thing},
where \texttt{module} is the filename (without the \texttt{.py} extension)
and \texttt{thing} is the name of the item.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{The \texttt{\_\_pycache\_\_} Directory}

When we import a file,
Python translates the source code into instructions called \gref{byte codes}{byte\_code}\index{byte code}
that it can execute efficiently.
Since the byte codes only change when the source changes,
Python saves the byte code in a separate file,
and reloads that file instead of re-translating the source code
the next time it's asked to import the file
(unless the file has changed,
in which case Python starts from the beginning).

Python creates a subdirectory called \texttt{\_\_pycache\_\_}\index{\_\_pycache\_\_ directory}
that holds the byte code for the files imported from that directory.
We typically don't want to put the files in \texttt{\_\_pycache\_\_} in version control,
so we normally tell Git to ignore it as discussed in Section~\ref{git-cmdline-ignore}.

\section{Plotting}\label{scripting-plotting}}

The last thing for us to do is to plot the word count distribution.
Recall that \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf\%27s_law}{Zipf's Law} states the second most common word in a body of text
appears half as often as the most common,
the third most common appears a third as often, and so on.
Mathematically, this might be written as
\enquote{word frequency is proportional to 1/rank.}

The following code plots the word frequency against the inverse rank

You'll build on this code to create a plotting script for your project

\hypertarget{scripting-summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{scripting-summary}}

Why is building a simple command-line tool so complex?
One answer is that the conventions for command-line programs
have evolved over several decades,
so libraries like \texttt{argparse} must now support several different generations of option handling.
Another is that the things we want to do genuinely \emph{are} complex:
read from either standard input or a list of files,
display help when asked to,
respect parameters that might not be there,
and so on.
As with many other things in programming (and life),
everyone wishes it was simpler,
but no one can agree on what to throw away.

The good news is that this complexity is a fixed cost:
our template for command-line tools can be re-used for programs
that are much larger than the examples shown in this chapter.
Making tools that behave in ways people expect
greatly increases the chances that others will find them useful.

\hypertarget{scripting-ex-command-line}{%
\subsection{Running Python statements from the command line}\label{scripting-ex-command-line}}

We don't need to open the interactive interpreter to run Python code.
Instead,
we can invoke Python with the command flag \texttt{-c}
and the statement we want to run:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ python }\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{c }\StringTok{"print(2+3)"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

When and why is this useful?

\hypertarget{scripting-ex-glob-ls}{%
\subsection{Listing files}\label{scripting-ex-glob-ls}}

A Python library called \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html}{glob} can be used to create a list of files
matching a pattern, much like the \texttt{ls} shell command.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Python 3.8.1 | packaged by conda-forge |
(default, Jan 29 2020, 14:55:04)
[GCC 7.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license"
for more information.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OperatorTok{>>>} \ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ glob}
\OperatorTok{>>>}\NormalTok{ glob.glob(}\StringTok{'data/*.txt'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
['data/moby_dick.txt', 'data/sense_and_sensibility.txt',
'data/sherlock_holmes.txt', 'data/time_machine.txt',
'data/frankenstein.txt', 'data/dracula.txt',
'data/jane_eyre.txt']
\end{verbatim}

Using \texttt{script\_template.py} as a guide,
write a new script called \texttt{my\_ls.py}
that takes as input a directory and suffix (e.g.~py, txt, md, sh)
and outputs a list of the files (sorted alphabetically)
in that directory ending in that suffix.

The help information for the new script should read as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/my_ls.py -h}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
usage: my_ls.py [-h] dir suffix

List the files in a given directory with a given suffix.

positional arguments:
  dir         Directory
  suffix      File suffix (e.g. py, sh)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
\end{verbatim}

and an example of the output would be:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/my_ls.py data/ txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
data/dracula.txt
data/frankenstein.txt
data/jane_eyre.txt
data/moby_dick.txt
data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
data/sherlock_holmes.txt
data/time_machine.txt
\end{verbatim}

Note: we will not be including this script in subsequent chapters.

\hypertarget{scripting-ex-sentence-endings}{%
\subsection{Sentence ending punctuation}\label{scripting-ex-sentence-endings}}

Our \texttt{countwords.py} script strips the punctuation from a text,
which means it provides no information on sentence endings.
Using \texttt{script\_template.py} and \texttt{countwords.py} as a guide,
write a new script called \texttt{sentence\_endings.py} that counts
the occurrence of full stops, question marks and exclamation points
and prints that information to the screen.

Hint: String objects have a \texttt{count} method, e.g:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Python 3.8.1 | packaged by conda-forge |
(default, Jan 29 2020, 14:55:04)
[GCC 7.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license"
for more information.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OperatorTok{>>>} \StringTok{"Hello! Are you ok?"}\NormalTok{.count(}\StringTok{'!'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
1
\end{verbatim}

When you're done,
the script should be able to accept an input file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/sentence_endings.py data/dracula.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Number of . is 8505
Number of ? is 492
Number of ! is 752
\end{verbatim}

or standard input:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 500 data/dracula.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/sentence_endings.py}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Number of . is 148
Number of ? is 8
Number of ! is 8
\end{verbatim}

Note: we will not be including this script in subsequent chapters.

\hypertarget{scripting-ex-better-plotting}{%
\subsection{A better plotting program}\label{scripting-ex-better-plotting}}

Using \texttt{script\_template.py} as a guide,
take the plotting code from Section~\ref{scripting-plotting}
and write a new Python program called \texttt{plotcounts.py}.
The script should:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Use the \texttt{type=argparse.FileType(\textquotesingle{}r\textquotesingle{})}, \texttt{nargs=\textquotesingle{}?\textquotesingle{}} and \texttt{default=\textquotesingle{}-\textquotesingle{}} options
  for the input file argument (i.e.~similar to the \texttt{countwords.py} script)
  so that \texttt{plotcounts.py} uses standard input if no csv file is given.
\item
  Include an optional \texttt{-\/-outfile} argument for the name of the output image file.
  The default value should be \texttt{plotcounts.png}.
\item
  Include an optional \texttt{-\/-xlim} argument so that the user can change the x-axis bounds.
\end{enumerate}

When you are done,
generate a plot for \emph{Jane Eyre} by passing the word counts to \texttt{plotcounts.py}
via a CSV file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/plotcounts.py results/jane_eyre.csv}
  \ExtensionTok{--outfile}\NormalTok{ results/jane_eyre.png}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and by standard input:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt }\KeywordTok{|} \ExtensionTok{python}
  \ExtensionTok{bin/plotcounts.py}\NormalTok{ --outfile results/jane_eyre.png}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note:
the solution to this exercise is used in following chapters.

\hypertarget{scripting-keypoints}{%

\item
  If the user does not specify any input files, read from \gref{standard input}{stdin}.
\item
  If the user does not specify any output files, write to \gref{standard output}{stdout}.
\item
  Place all \texttt{import} statements at the start of a module.
\item
  Use the value of \texttt{\_\_name\_\_} to determine if a file is being run directly or being loaded as a module.
\item
  Use \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html}{\texttt{argparse}} to handle command-line arguments in standard ways.
\item
  Use \gref{short options}{short\_option} for common controls and \gref{long options}{long\_option} for less common or more complicated ones.
\item
  Use \gref{docstrings}{docstring} to document functions and scripts.
\item
  Place functions that are used across multiple scripts in a separate file that those scripts can import.

+++ Divide By Cucumber Error. Please Reinstall Universe And Reboot +++

--- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}
\end{quote}

A \gref{version control system}{version\_control\_system} tracks changes to files\index{version control}
and helps people share those changes with each other.
These things can be done by emailing files to colleagues
or by using Microsoft Word and Google Docs,
but version control does both more accurately and efficiently.
Originally developed to support software development,
over the past fifteen years it has become the cornerstone
of \gref{reproducible research}{reproducible\_research}.\index{reproducible research!version control}

Version control works by storing a master copy of your code in a repository,
which you can't edit directly.
Instead, you check out a working copy of the code,
edit that code, then commit changes back to the repository.
In this way, version control records a complete revision history (i.e.~of every commit),
so that you can retrieve and compare previous versions at any time.
This is useful from an individual viewpoint,
because you don't need to store multiple (but slightly different) copies of the same script
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-cmdline-phdcomics}).
It's also useful from a collaboration viewpoint,
because the system keeps a record of who made what changes and when.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-cmdline/phd-comics} 

}

\caption{Managing different versions of a file without version control.}\label{fig:git-cmdline-phdcomics}
\end{figure}

There are many different version control systems,
such as CVS, Subversion, and Mercurial,
but the most widely used version control system today is \gref{Git}{git}.
Many people first encounter it through a GUI like \href{https://www.gitkraken.com/}{GitKraken}
or \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/}{the RStudio IDE}.
However,
these tools are actually wrappers around Git's original command-line interface,
which gives us access to all of Git's features.
This lesson describes how to perform fundamental operations using that interface;
Chapter~\ref{git-advanced} then introduces more advanced operations
that can be used to implement a smoother research workflow.

To show how Git works,
we will apply it to the Zipf's Law project.
Our project directory should currently include:

\begin{verbatim}
zipf/
├── bin
│   ├── book_summary.sh
│   ├── collate.py
│   ├── countwords.py
│   ├── plotcounts.py
│   ├── script_template.py
│   └── utilities.py
├── data
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── dracula.txt
│   ├── frankenstein.txt
│   └── ...
└── results
    ├── dracula.csv
    ├── jane_eyre.csv
    ├── jane_eyre.png
    └── moby_dick.csv
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{bin/plotcounts.py} is the solution to Exercise~\ref{scripting-ex-better-plotting};
over the course of this chapter
we will edit it to produce more informative plots.
Initially,
it looks like this:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{git-cmdline-setup}{%
\section{Setting Up}\label{git-cmdline-setup}}

We write Git commands as \texttt{git\ verb\ options},
where the \gref{subcommand}{subcommand} \texttt{verb} tells Git what we want to do
and \texttt{options} provide whatever additional information that subcommand needs.
Using this syntax,
the first thing we need to do is configure Git.\index{Git!configuration}\index{configuration!Git}\index{Git commands!config}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ config --global user.name }\StringTok{"Amira Khan"}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ config --global user.email }\StringTok{"amira@zipf.org"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

(Please use your own name and email address instead of the one shown.)
Here,
\texttt{config} is the verb
and the rest of the command are options.
We put the name in quotation marks because it contains a space;
we don't actually need to quote the email address,
but do so for consistency.
Since we are going to be using GitHub,
the email address should be the same as you have or intend to use
when setting up your GitHub account.

The \texttt{-\/-global} option tells Git to use the settings for all of our projects on this computer,
so these two commands only need to be run once.
However,
we can re-run them any time if we want to change our details.
We can also check our settings using the \texttt{-\/-list} option:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ config --list}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
user.name=Amira Khan
user.email=amira@zipf.org
core.autocrlf=input
core.editor=nano
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.bare=false
core.ignorecase=true
...
\end{verbatim}

Depending on your operating system and version of Git,
your configuration list may look a bit different.
Most of these differences shouldn't matter right now,
as long as your user name and email are accurate.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Git Help and Manual}

If we forget a Git command,
we can list which ones are available using \texttt{-\/-help}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ --help}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This option also gives us more information about specific commands:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ config --help}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{git-cmdline-repos}{%
\section{Creating a New Repository}\label{git-cmdline-repos}}

Once Git is configured,
we can use it to track work on our Zipf's Law project.
Let's make sure we are in the top-level directory of our project:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ~/zipf}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
 bin       data      results
\end{verbatim}

We want to make this directory a \gref{repository}{repository},\index{repository (version control)}\index{Git commands!init}
i.e.,
a place where Git can store versions of our files.
We do this using the \texttt{init} command with \texttt{.} to mean \enquote{the current directory}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ init .}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/amira/zipf/.git/
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{ls} seems to show that nothing has changed:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
bin     data    results
\end{verbatim}

but if we add the \texttt{-a} flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within \texttt{zipf} called \texttt{.git}:\index{Git!.git directory}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ -a}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
.       ..      .git    bin     data    results
\end{verbatim}

Git stores information about the project in this special subdirectory.
If we ever delete it,
we will lose that history.

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ status}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will
  be committed)

        bin/
        data/
        results/

nothing added to commit but untracked files
present (use "git add" to track)
\end{verbatim}

\enquote{No commits yet} means that Git hasn't recorded any history yet,
while \enquote{Untracked files} means Git has noticed that
there are things in \texttt{bin/}, \texttt{data/} and \texttt{results/}
that it is not yet keeping track of.

\hypertarget{git-cmdline-add-existing}{%
\section{Adding Existing Work}\label{git-cmdline-add-existing}}

Now that our project is a repository,
we can tell Git to start recording its history.
To do this,
we add things to the list of things Git is tracking using \texttt{git\ add}.\index{Git commands!add}
We can do this for single files:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ add bin/countwords.py}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or entire directories:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ add bin}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The easiest thing to do with an existing project
is to tell Git to add everything in the current directory using \texttt{.}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ add .}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can then check the repository's status to see what files have been added:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ status}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   bin/book_summary.sh
        new file:   bin/collate.py
        new file:   bin/countwords.py
        new file:   bin/plotcounts.py
        new file:   bin/script_template.py
        new file:   bin/utilities.py
        new file:   data/README.md
        new file:   data/dracula.txt
        new file:   data/frankenstein.txt
        new file:   data/jane_eyre.txt
        new file:   data/moby_dick.txt
        new file:   data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
        new file:   data/sherlock_holmes.txt
        new file:   data/time_machine.txt
        new file:   results/dracula.csv
        new file:   results/jane_eyre.csv
        new file:   results/moby_dick.csv
        new file:   results/jane_eyre.png
\end{verbatim}

Adding all of our existing files this way is easy,
but we can accidentally add things that should never be in version control,
such as files containing passwords or other sensitive information.
The output of \texttt{git\ status} tells us that\index{Git commands!status}
we can remove such files from the list of things to be saved
using \texttt{git\ rm\ -\/-cached};\index{Git commands!rm}
we will practice this in Exercise~\ref{git-cmdline-ex-unsave}.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{What to Save}

We always want to save programs, manuscripts,
and everything else we have created by hand
in version control.
In this project,
we have also chosen to save our data files
and the results we have generated
(including our plots).
This is a project-specific decision:
if these files are very large,
for example,
we may decide to save them elsewhere,
while if they are easy to re-create,
we may not save them at all.
We will explore this issue further in Chapter~\ref{provenance}.
\end{quote}

We no longer have any untracked files,
but the tracked files haven't been \gref{committed}{commit}\index{Git commands!commit}\index{commit!to version control}
(i.e., saved permanently in our project's history).
We can do this using \texttt{git\ commit}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ commit -m }\StringTok{"Add scripts, novels, word counts, and plots"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\texttt{git\ commit} takes everything we have told Git to save using \texttt{git\ add}
and stores a copy permanently inside the repository's \texttt{.git} directory.
This permanent copy is called a \gref{commit}{commit} or a \gref{revision}{revision}.\index{commit!set of files}
Git gives is a unique identifier,
and the first line of output from \texttt{git\ commit} displays
its \gref{short identifier}{short\_identifier\_git} \texttt{31a216a},\index{Git!short identifier}\index{short identifier (in Git)}
which is the first few characters of that unique label.

We use the \texttt{-m} option (short for \textbf{m}essage)
to record a short comment with the commit
to remind us later what we did and why.
(Once again,
we put it in double quotes because it contains spaces.)
If we run \texttt{git\ status} now:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ status}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

the output tells us that
all of our existing work is tracked and up to date:

\begin{verbatim}
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
\end{verbatim}

This first commit becomes the starting point of our project's history:
we won't be able to see changes made before this point.
This implies that we should make our project a Git repository
as soon as we create it
rather than after we have done some work.

\hypertarget{git-cmdline-commit-message}{%
\section{Describing Commits}\label{git-cmdline-commit-message}}

If we run \texttt{git\ commit} \emph{without} the \texttt{-m} option,
Git opens a text editor
so that we can write a longer \gref{commit message}{commit\_message}.\index{Git!commit message}\index{commit!message}
In this message,
the first line is referred to as the \enquote{subject}
and the rest as the \enquote{body},
just as in an email.

When we use \texttt{-m},
we are only writing the subject line;
this makes things easier in the short run,
but if our project's history fills up with one-liners like
\enquote{Fixed problem} or \enquote{Updated},
our future self will wish that we had taken a few extra seconds
to explain things in a little more detail.
Following \href{https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/}{these guidelines} will help:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
  so that it is easy to spot.
\item
  Limit subject lines to 50 characters so that they are easy to scan.
\item
  Write the subject line in Title Case (like a section heading).
\item
  Do not end the subject line with a period.
\item
  Write as if giving a command
  (e.g., \enquote{Make each plot half the width of the page}).
\item
  Wrap the body
  (i.e., insert line breaks to format text as paragraphs
  rather than relying on editors to wrap lines automatically).
\item
  Use the body to explain what and why rather than how.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Which Editor?}

The default editor in the Unix shell is called Vim.
It has many useful features,
but no one has ever claimed that its interface is intuitive.
(\enquote{How do I exit the Vim editor?}
is one of the most frequently read questions on Stack Overflow.)

To configure Git to use the \texttt{nano} editor
introduced in Chapter~\ref{bash-basics} instead,
execute the following command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ config --global core.editor }\StringTok{"nano -w"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{git-cmdline-changes}{%
\section{Saving and Tracking Changes}\label{git-cmdline-changes}}

Our initial commit gave us a starting point.
The process to build on top of it is similar:
first add the file, then commit changes.
Let's check that we're in the right directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{pwd}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
/Users/amira/zipf
\end{verbatim}

Let's use \texttt{plotcounts.py} to plot the word counts in \texttt{results/dracula.csv}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/plotcounts.py results/dracula.csv --outfile}
  \ExtensionTok{results/dracula.png}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If we check the status of our repository again,
Git tells us that we have a new file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ status}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will
  be committed)

        results/dracula.png

nothing added to commit but untracked files
present (use "git add" to track)
\end{verbatim}

Git isn't tracking this file yet because we haven't told it to.
Let's do that with \texttt{git\ add} and then commit our change:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ add results/dracula.png}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ commit -m }\StringTok{"Add plot of word counts for 'Dracula'"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[master 65b7e61] Add plot of word counts for 'Dracula'
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 results/dracula.png
\end{verbatim}

If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can display the project's history using \texttt{git\ log}:\index{Git commands!log}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ log}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
commit 65b7e6129f978f6b99bae6b16c5704a9ce079afa (HEAD -> master)
Author: Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
Date:   Thu Feb 20 10:46:19 2020 -0800

    Add plot of word counts for 'Dracula'

commit 31a216a6119de9a8d2233e5e275af9a2967415af
Author: Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
Date:   Wed Feb 19 15:39:04 2020 -0800

    Add scripts, novels, word counts, and plots
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{git\ log} lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's \gref{full identifier}{full\_identifier\_git}\index{Git!full identifier}\index{full identifier (in Git)}
(which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by \texttt{git\ commit}),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the commit message that we wrote.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Scrolling through logs}

Our log this time isn't very long,
so you were likely able to see it printed to your screen without needing to scroll.
When you begin working with longer logs
(like later in this chapter),
you'll notice that the commits are shown in a pager program,
as you saw in Section~\ref{bash-basics-help} with manual pages.
You can apply the same keystrokes to scroll through the log
and exit the paging program.\index{Unix shell!paging program}\index{paging program (in Unix shell)}
\end{quote}

The plot we have made is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:git-cmdline-initial-plot}.
It could be better:
most of the visual space is devoted to a few very common words,
which makes it hard to see what is happening with the other ten thousand or so words.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-cmdline/plot-initial} 

}

\caption{Inverse rank versus word frequency for Dracula.}\label{fig:git-cmdline-initial-plot}
\end{figure}

An alternative way to visually evaluate Zipf's Law is
to plot the word frequency against rank on log-log axes.
Let's change the section:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{    ax }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ df.plot.scatter(x}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'word_frequency'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{                         y}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'inverse_rank'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{                         figsize}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{[}\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{],}
\NormalTok{                         grid}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{True}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{                         xlim}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{args.xlim)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

to put \texttt{\textquotesingle{}rank\textquotesingle{}} on the y-axis and add \texttt{loglog=True}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{    ax }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ df.plot.scatter(x}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'word_frequency'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{                         y}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'rank'}\NormalTok{, loglog}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{True}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{                         figsize}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{[}\DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{],}
\NormalTok{                         grid}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{True}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{                         xlim}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{args.xlim)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When we run \texttt{git\ status} now,
it prints:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ status}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   bin/plotcounts.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
\end{verbatim}

The last line tells us that
a file Git already knows about has been modified.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Hints from Git}

After executing Git commands,
you may see output that differs slightly from what is shown here.
For example,
you may see a suggestion for \texttt{git\ checkout}
in place of \texttt{git\ restore} after executing the code above,
which means you're running an different version of Git.
As with most tasks in coding,
there are often multiple commands to accomplish the same action with Git.
This chapter will show output from Git version 2.29.
If you see something different in your Git output,
you can try the commands we present here,
or follow the suggestions included in the output you see.
When in doubt,
check the documentation (e.g., \texttt{git\ checkout\ -\/-help})
if you get stuck.
\end{quote}

To save those changes in the repository's history,
we must \texttt{git\ add} and then \texttt{git\ commit}.
Before we do,
though,
let's review the changes using \texttt{git\ diff}.\index{Git commands!diff}\index{diff (in Git)}
This command shows us the differences between the current state of our repository
and the most recently saved version:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ diff}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{diff --git a/bin/plotcounts.py b/bin/plotcounts.py}
\NormalTok{index 13e7f38..a6005cd 100644}
\DataTypeTok{--- a/bin/plotcounts.py}
\DataTypeTok{+++ b/bin/plotcounts.py}
\DataTypeTok{@@ -8,7 +8,7 @@ def main(args):}
\NormalTok{     df = pd.read_csv(args.infile, header=None,}
\NormalTok{                      names=('word', 'word_frequency'))}
\NormalTok{     df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,}
\NormalTok{                                            method='max')}
\NormalTok{     df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']}
\NormalTok{     ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',}
\StringTok{-                         y='inverse_rank',}
\VariableTok{+                         y='rank', loglog=True,}
\NormalTok{                          figsize=[12, 6],}
\NormalTok{                          grid=True,}
\NormalTok{                          xlim=args.xlim)}
\NormalTok{     ax.figure.savefig(args.outfile)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The output is cryptic,
even by the standards of the Unix command line,
because it is actually a series of commands telling editors and other tools
how to turn the file we \emph{had} into the file we \emph{have}.
If we break it down into pieces:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The first line tells us that Git is producing output
  in the format of the Unix \texttt{diff} command.
\item
  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file Git is comparing:
  \texttt{13e7f38} and \texttt{a6005cd} are the short identifiers for those versions.
\item
  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed;
  the name appears twice in case we are renaming a file as well as modifying it.
\item
  The remaining lines show us the changes and the lines on which they occur.
  A minus sign \texttt{-} in the first column indicates a line that is being removed,
  while a plus sign \texttt{+} shows a line that is being added. Lines without either
  plus or minus signs have not been changed, but are provided around the lines
  that have been changed to add context.
\end{enumerate}

Git's default is to compare line by line,
but it can be instructive to instead compare word by word
using the \texttt{-\/-word-diff} or \texttt{-\/-color-words} options.
These are particularly useful when running \texttt{git\ diff} on prose rather than code.

After reviewing our change
we can commit it just as we did before:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ commit -m }\StringTok{"Plot frequency against rank on log-log axes"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
        modified:   bin/plotcounts.py

no changes added to commit
\end{verbatim}

Whoops:
we forgot to add the file to the set of things we want to commit.
Let's do that and then try the commit again:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ add bin/plotcounts.py}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ status}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   bin/plotcounts.py
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ commit -m }\StringTok{"Plot frequency against rank on log-log axes"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[master b5176bf] Plot frequency against rank on log-log axes
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{The Staging Area}

Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit before actually committing anything.
This allows us to commit our changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions
rather than only large batches.
For example,
suppose we add a few citations to the introduction of our thesis,
which is in the file \texttt{introduction.tex}.
We might want to commit those additions
but not commit the changes to \texttt{conclusion.tex} (which we haven't finished writing yet).
To allow for this,
Git has a special \gref{staging area}{git\_stage}\index{staging area (in Git)}\index{Git!staging area}
where it keeps track of things
that have been added to the current changeset but not yet committed
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-cmdline-staging-area}).
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-cmdline/staging-area} 

}

\caption{The staging area in Git.}\label{fig:git-cmdline-staging-area}
\end{figure}

Let's take a look at our new plot (Figure~\ref{fig:git-cmdline-loglog-plot}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/plotcounts.py results/dracula.csv --outfile}
  \ExtensionTok{results/dracula.png}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-cmdline/plot-loglog} 

}

\caption{Rank versus word frequency on log-log axes for 'Dracula'.}\label{fig:git-cmdline-loglog-plot}
\end{figure}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Interpreting Our Plot}

If Zipf's Law holds,
we should still see a linear relationship,
although now it will be negative, rather than positive
(since we're plotting the rank instead of the reverse rank).
The low-frequency words (below about 120 instances)
seem to follow a straight line very closely,
but we currently have to make this evaluation by eye.
In the next chapter,
we'll write code to fit and add a line to our plot.
\end{quote}

Running \texttt{git\ status} again shows that our plot has been modified:

\begin{verbatim}
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be
  committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in
  working directory)

        modified:   results/dracula.png

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
\end{verbatim}

Since \texttt{results/dracula.png} is a binary file rather than text,
\texttt{git\ diff} can't show what has changed.
It therefore simply tells us that the new file is different from the old one:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{diff --git a/results/dracula.png b/results/dracula.png}
\NormalTok{index d8162ac..e9fe7f8 100644}
\NormalTok{Binary files a/results/dracula.png and}
\NormalTok{b/results/dracula.png differ}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This is one of the biggest weaknesses of Git
(and other version control systems):
they are built to handle text.
They can track changes to images, PDFs, and other formats,
but they cannot do as much to show or merge differences.
In a better world than ours,
programmers fixed this years ago.

If we are sure we want to save all of our changes,
we can add and commit in a single command
by giving \texttt{git\ commit} the \texttt{-a} option:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ commit -a -m }\StringTok{"Update dracula plot"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[master d77bc5c] Update dracula plot
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rewrite results/dracula.png (99%)
\end{verbatim}

The Git commands we've covered so far (\texttt{git\ add}, \texttt{git\ commit}, \texttt{git\ diff})
represent the tasks you perform in a basic Git workflow in a local repository
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-cmdline-remote}a).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-cmdline/git-remote} 

}

\caption{Commands included in basic Git workflows.}\label{fig:git-cmdline-remote}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{git-cmdline-remotes}{%
\section{Synchronizing with Other Repositories}\label{git-cmdline-remotes}}

Sooner or later our computer will experience a hardware failure,
be stolen,
or be thrown in the lake by someone who thinks that
we shouldn't spend the entire vacation working on our thesis.
Even before that happens
we will probably want to collaborate with others,
which we can do by linking our local repository
to one stored on a hosting service such as \href{https://github.com}{GitHub}.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Where's My Repository?}

So far we've worked with repositories located on your own computer,
which we'll also refer to as local or desktop repositories.
The alternative is hosting repositories on GitHub or another server,
which we'll refer to as a remote or GitHub repository.
\end{quote}

The first steps are to create an account on GitHub,
and then to create a new repository to synchronize with.
The remote repository doesn't have to have the same name as the local one,
but we will probably get confused if they are different,
so the repository we create on GitHub will also be called \texttt{zipf}.

Next,
we need to connect our desktop repository with the one on GitHub.
We do this by making the GitHub repository a \gref{remote}{remote\_repository}\index{Git!remote}\index{remote (in Git)}
of the local repository.
The home page of our new repository on GitHub includes the string we need to identify it
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-cmdline-repo-link}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-cmdline/repo-link} 

}

\caption{Find the link for a GitHub repository.}\label{fig:git-cmdline-repo-link}
\end{figure}

We can click on \enquote{HTTPS} to change the URL from SSH to HTTPS
and then copy that URL.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{HTTPS vs.~SSH}

We use HTTPS here because it does not require additional configuration.
If we want to set up SSH access so that we do not have to type in our password as often,
the tutorials from \href{https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys}{GitHub},
\href{https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-ssh-for-git-728138079.html}{BitBucket},
or \href{https://about.gitlab.com/2014/03/04/add-ssh-key-screencast/}{GitLab}
explain the steps required.
\end{quote}

Next,
let's go into the local \texttt{zipf} repository and run this command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ~/zipf}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ remote add origin https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Make sure to use the URL for your repository instead of the one shown:
the only difference should be that it includes your username instead of \texttt{amira-khan}.

A Git remote is like a bookmark:\index{Git!remote}\index{Git commands!remote}\index{remote (in Git)}
it gives a short name to a URL.
In this case the remote's name is \texttt{origin};
we could use anything we want,
but \texttt{origin} is Git's default,
so we will stick with it.
We can check that the command has worked by running \texttt{git\ remote\ -v}
(where the \texttt{-v} option is short for \textbf{v}erbose):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ remote -v}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
origin  https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git (push)
\end{verbatim}

Git displays two lines because it's actually possible to set up a remote
to download from one URL but upload to another.
Sensible people don't do this,
so we won't explore this possibility any further.

Now that we have configured a remote,
we can \gref{push}{git\_push} the work we have done so far\index{Git commands!push}\index{push (in Git)}
to the repository on GitHub:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ push origin master}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This may prompt us to enter our username and password;
once we do that,
Git prints a few lines of administrative information:

\begin{verbatim}
Enumerating objects: 33, done.
Counting objects: 100% (33/33), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (33/33), done.

To https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.
\end{verbatim}

If we view our GitHub repository in the browser,
it now includes all of our project files,
along with all of the commits we have made so far (Figure~\ref{fig:git-cmdline-history}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-cmdline/repo-history} 

}

\caption{Viewing the repository's history on GitHub.}\label{fig:git-cmdline-history}
\end{figure}

We can also \gref{pull}{git\_pull} changes\index{Git commands!pull}\index{pull (in Git)}
from the remote repository to the local one:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ pull origin master}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Pulling has no effect in this case
because the two repositories are already synchronized.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Fetching}

The second line in the remote configuration we viewed earlier is labeled \texttt{push},
which makes sense given the command we used (\texttt{git\ push})
to upload changes from our local to remote repositories.
Why is the other line labeled \texttt{fetch} instead of \texttt{pull}?
Fetching and pulling both download new data from a remote repository,
but only pulling integrates those changes into your local repository's version history.
Because \texttt{git\ fetch} doesn't alter your local files,
it's used to view changes between local and remote versions.\index{Git commands!fetch}
\end{quote}

The Git commands we've covered in this section (\texttt{git\ pull}, \texttt{git\ push})
are the main tasks associated with incorporating remote repositories into your workflow
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-cmdline-remote}b).

\hypertarget{git-cmdline-history}{%
\section{Exploring History}\label{git-cmdline-history}}

Git lets us look at previous versions of files
and restore specific files to earlier states if we want to.
In order to do these things,
we need to identify the versions we want.

The two ways to do this
are analogous to \gref{absolute}{absolute\_path} and \gref{relative}{relative\_path} paths.
The \enquote{absolute} version is the unique identifier that Git gives to each commit.
These identifiers are 40 characters long,
but in most situations Git will let us use just the first half dozen characters or so.
For example,
if we run \texttt{git\ log}\index{Git commands!log} right now,
it shows us something like this:

\begin{verbatim}

Date:   Wed Feb 19 15:39:04 2020 -0800

    Add scripts, novels, word counts, and plots
\end{verbatim}

The commit in which we changed \texttt{plotcounts.py}
has the absolute identifier \texttt{b5176bfd2ce9650ad5e79e117cd68a666c9cdabc},
but we can use \texttt{b5176bf} to reference it in almost all situations.

While \texttt{git\ log} includes the commit message,
it doesn't tell us exactly what changes were made in each commit.
If we add the \texttt{-p} option (short for \textbf{p}atch),
we get the same kind of details \texttt{git\ diff} provides
to describe the changes in each commit:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ log -p}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The first part of the output is shown below;
we have truncated the rest,
since it is very long:

\begin{verbatim}

    Update dracula plot

diff --git a/results/dracula.png b/results/dracula.png
index 8e3ff84..af8e892 100644
Binary files a/results/dracula.png and
b/results/dracula.png differ
...
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively,
we can use \texttt{git\ diff} directly\index{Git commands!diff}
to examine the differences between files at any stage in the repository's history.
Let's explore this with the \texttt{plotcounts.py} file.
We no longer need the line of code in \texttt{plotcounts.py}
that calculates the inverse rank:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{df[}\StringTok{'inverse_rank'}\NormalTok{] }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{ df[}\StringTok{'rank'}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If we delete that line from \texttt{bin/plotcounts.py},
\texttt{git\ diff} on its own will show
the difference between the file as it is now and the most recent version:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

Note that you may need to use something other than \texttt{b5176bf},
since Git may have assigned your commit a different unique identifier.
Note also that we have \emph{not} committed this change:
we will look at ways of undoing it in the next section.

The \enquote{relative} version of history relies on a special identifier called \texttt{HEAD},\index{Git!HEAD}\index{HEAD (in Git)}
which always refers to the most recent version in the repository.
\texttt{git\ diff\ HEAD} therefore shows the same thing as \texttt{git\ diff},
but instead of typing in a version identifier to back up one commit,
we can use \texttt{HEAD\textasciitilde{}1} (where \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} is the tilde symbol).\index{Git!relative revision}
This shorthand is read \enquote{HEAD minus one},
and gives us the difference to the previous saved version.
\texttt{git\ diff\ HEAD\textasciitilde{}2} goes back two revisions and so on.
We can also look at the differences between two saved versions
by separating their identifiers with two dots \texttt{..} like this:

\begin{Shaded}

If we wanted to view the contents of a file
at a given point in the version history,
we could use the same command,
but separating the identifier and file with a colon:

\begin{verbatim}
$ git show HEAD~1:bin/plotcounts.py
\end{verbatim}

This allows us to look through the file using a paging program.

\hypertarget{git-cmdline-restore}{%
\section{Restoring Old Versions of Files}\label{git-cmdline-restore}}

We can see what we changed,
but how can we restore it?\index{Git!restore old versions}
Suppose we change our mind about the last update to \texttt{bin/plotcounts.py}
before we add it or commit it.
\texttt{git\ status} tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been \gref{staged}{git\_stage}:\index{Git!staging area}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ status}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be
  committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes
  in working directory)

        modified:   bin/plotcounts.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
\end{verbatim}

We can put things back the way they were in the last saved revision
using \texttt{git\ restore},\index{Git commands!restore}
as the screen output suggests:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ restore bin/plotcounts.py}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ status}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
\end{verbatim}

As its name suggests,
\texttt{git\ restore} restores an earlier version of a file.
In this case,
we used it to recover the version of the file in the most recent commit.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Checking Out with Git}

If you're running a different version of Git,
you may see a suggestion for \texttt{git\ checkout} instead of \texttt{git\ restore}.
As of Git version 2.29,
\texttt{git\ restore} is still an experimental command.
\texttt{git\ checkout} is a generally used to switch among versions of working files.
\texttt{git\ checkout\ HEAD\ bin/plotcounts.py} is equivalent to the last command run.\index{Git commands!checkout}
\end{quote}

We can confirm the file has been restored
by printing the relevant lines of the file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{ -n 12 bin/plotcounts.py }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{tail}\NormalTok{ -4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
    df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,
                                           method='max')
    df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='rank', loglog=True,
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)
\end{verbatim}

Because \texttt{git\ restore} is designed to restore working files,
we'll need to use \texttt{git\ checkout} to revert to earlier versions of files.\index{Git commands!checkout}
We can use a specific commit identifier rather than \texttt{HEAD} to go back as far as we want:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ checkout 65b7e61 bin/countwords.py}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Doing this does not change the history:
\texttt{git\ log} still shows our four commits.
Instead,
it replaces the content of the file with the old content:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ status}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   bin/plotcounts.py
\end{verbatim}

Notice that the changes have already been added to the staging area for new commits.
If we change our mind again,
we can return the file to the state of the most recent commit using \texttt{git\ reset}:\index{Git commands!reset}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ reset HEAD bin/countwords.py}

    df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='rank', loglog=True,
                         figsize=[12, 6],

                         xlim=args.xlim)
\end{verbatim}

Since we didn't commit the change
that removed the line that calculates the inverse rank,
that work is now lost:
Git can only go back and forth between committed versions of files.

This section has demonstrated a few different ways to view differences among versions,
and to work with those changes (Figure~\ref{fig:git-cmdline-remote}c).
These commands can operate on either individual files or entire commits,
and the behavior of them can sometimes differ based on your version of Git.
Remember to reference documentation,
and use \texttt{git\ status} and \texttt{git\ log} frequently to understand your workflow.

\hypertarget{git-cmdline-ignore}{%
\section{Ignoring Files}\label{git-cmdline-ignore}}

We don't always want Git to track every file's history.
For example,
we might want to track text files with names ending in \texttt{.txt}
but not data files with names ending in \texttt{.dat}.

To stop Git from telling us about these files every time we call \texttt{git\ status},
we can create a file in the root directory of our project called \texttt{.gitignore}.\index{Git!ignoring files}\index{.gitignore file (in Git)}
This file can contain filenames like \texttt{thesis.pdf}
or \gref{wildcard}{wildcard} patterns like \texttt{*.dat}.\index{wildcard!in .gitignore}
Each must be on a line of its own,
and Git will ignore anything that matches any of these lines.
For now we only need one entry in our \texttt{.gitignore} file:

\begin{verbatim}
__pycache__
\end{verbatim}

which tells Git to ignore any \texttt{\_\_pycache\_\_} directory created by Python\index{\_\_pycache\_\_ directory!ignoring in Git}
(Section~\ref{scripting-modules}).

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Remember to Ignore}

Don't forget to commit \texttt{.gitignore} to your repository
so that Git knows to use it.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{git-cmdline-summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{git-cmdline-summary}}

The biggest benefit of version control for individual research is that
we can always go back to the precise set of files
that we used to produce a particular result.
While Git is complex (Perez De Rosso and Jackson \protect\hyperlink{ref-Pere2013}{2013}),
being able to back up our changes on sites like GitHub
with just a few keystrokes can save us a lot of pain,
and some of Git's advanced features make it even more powerful.
We will explore these in the next chapter.

Along with information about the Zipf's Law project,
Amira would also like to keep some notes on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaps\%27_law}{Heaps' Law}.

Amira creates a \texttt{heaps-law} project inside her \texttt{zipf} project as follows:

Two of Git's advanced features let us to do much more than just track our work.
\gref{Branches}{git\_branch} let us work on multiple things simultaneously in a single repository;
\gref{pull requests}{pull\_request} (PRs) let us submit our work for review,
get feedback,
and make updates.
Used together,
they allow us to go through the write-review-revise cycle
familiar to anyone who has ever written a journal paper
in hours rather than weeks.

Your \texttt{zipf} project directory should now include:

\begin{verbatim}

using Git's advanced features.

\hypertarget{git-advanced-branch-what}{%
\section{What's a Branch?}\label{git-advanced-branch-what}}

So far we have only used a sequential timeline with Git:
each change builds on the one before,
and \emph{only} on the one before.
However,
there are times when we want to try things out
without disrupting our main work.
To do this, we can use \gref{branches}{git\_branch} to work on separate tasks in parallel.\index{branch (in Git)}\index{Git!branch}
Each branch is a parallel timeline;
changes made on the branch only affect that branch
unless and until we explicitly combine them with work done in another branch.

We can see what branches exist in a repository using this command:\index{Git commands!branch}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ branch}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
* master
\end{verbatim}

When we initialize a repository,
Git automatically creates a branch called \texttt{master}.\index{Git!master branch}
It is often considered the \enquote{official} version of the repository.
The asterisk \texttt{*} indicates that it is currently active,
i.e.,
that all changes we make will take place in this branch by default.
(The active branch is like the \gref{current working directory}{current\_working\_directory} in the shell.)

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Default branches}

In mid-2020,
GitHub changed the name of the default branch
(the first branch created when a repository is initialized)
from \enquote{master} to \enquote{main.}
Owners of repositories may also change the name of the default branch.
This means that the name of the default branch may be different among repositories
based on when and where it was created,
as well as who manages it.
\end{quote}

In the previous chapter,
we foreshadowed some experimental changes that we could try and make to \texttt{plotcounts.py}.

Making sure our project directory is our working directory,
we can inspect our current \texttt{plotcounts.py}:

We used this version of \texttt{plotcounts.py}
to display the word counts for \emph{Dracula} on a log-log plot
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-cmdline-loglog-plot}).
The relationship between word count and rank looked linear,
but since the eye is easily fooled,
we should fit a curve to the data.
Doing this will require more than just a trivial change to the script,
so to ensure that this version of \texttt{plotcounts.py} keeps working
while we try to build a new one,
we will do our work in a separate branch.
Once we have successfully added curve fitting to \texttt{plotcounts.py},
we can decide if we want to merge our changes back into the \texttt{master} branch.

\hypertarget{git-advanced-branch-how}{%
\section{Creating a Branch}\label{git-advanced-branch-how}}

To create a new branch called \texttt{fit},
we run:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ branch fit}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can check that the branch exists by running \texttt{git\ branch} again:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ branch}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
* master
  fit
\end{verbatim}

Our branch is there,
but the asterisk \texttt{*} shows that we are still in the \texttt{master} branch.
(By analogy,
creating a new directory doesn't automatically move us into that directory.)
As a further check,
let's see what our repository's status is:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ status}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
\end{verbatim}

To switch to our new branch we can use the \texttt{checkout} command\index{Git commands!checkout}
that we first saw in Section~\ref{git-cmdline-restore}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ checkout fit}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ branch}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  master
* fit
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{git\ checkout} doesn't just check out a file from a specific commit:
it can also check out the whole repository,
i.e.,
switch it from one saved state to another.
We should choose the name to signal the purpose of the branch,
just as we choose the names of files and variables to indicate what they are for.
We haven't made any changes since switching to the \texttt{fit} branch,
so at this point \texttt{master} and \texttt{fit} are at the same point in the repository's history.
Commands like \texttt{ls} and \texttt{git\ log} therefore show that the files and history haven't changed.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Where Are Branches Saved?}

Git saves every version of every file in the \texttt{.git} directory\index{Git!.git directory}
that it creates in the project's root directory.
When we switch from one branch to another,
it replaces the files we see with
their counterparts from the branch we're switching to.
It also rearranges directories as needed
so that those files are in the right places.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{git-advanced-theory}{%
\section{What Curve Should We Fit?}\label{git-advanced-theory}}

Before we make any changes to our new branch,
we need to figure out how to fit a line to the word count data.
Zipf's Law says that:

\begin{quote}
The second most common word in a body of text
appears half as often as the most common,
the third most common appears a third as often, and so on.
\end{quote}

In other words,
the frequency of a word (\(f\)) is proportional to its inverse rank (\(r\)), \[
f \propto \frac{1}{r^\alpha}
\]
with a value of \(\alpha\) close to one.
The reason \(\alpha\) must be close to one for Zipf's Law to hold
becomes clear if we include it in a modified version of the earlier definition:

\begin{quote}
The most frequent word will occur approximately \(2^\alpha\) times
as often as the second most frequent word,
\(3^\alpha\) times as often as the third most frequent word, and so on.
\end{quote}

This mathematical expression for Zipf's Law is an example of a \gref{power law}{power\_law}.\index{power law}
In general, when two variables \(x\) and \(y\)
are related through a power law, so that \[
y = ax^b
\]
taking logarithms of both sides yields a linear relationship: \[
\log(y) = \log(a) + b\log(x)
\]

Hence,
plotting the variables on a log-log scale reveals this linear relationship.
If Zipf's Law holds,
we should have \[
r = cf^{\frac{-1}{\alpha}}
\]
where \(c\) is a constant of proportionality.
The linear relationship between the log word frequency and
log rank is then \[
\log(r) = \log(c) - \frac{1}{\alpha}\log(f)
\]
This suggests that the points on our log-log plot should fall on a straight line
with a slope of \(- \tfrac{1}{\alpha}\)
and intercept \(\log(c)\).
To fit a line to our word count data we therefore need to estimate the value of \(\alpha\);
we'll see later that \(c\) is completely defined.

In order to determine the best method for estimating \(\alpha\) we turn to Moreno-Sánchez, Font-Clos, and Corral (\protect\hyperlink{ref-More2016}{2016}),
which suggests using a method called \gref{maximum likelihood estimation}{maximum\_likelihood\_estimation}.\index{maximum likelihood estimation}
The likelihood function is the probability of our observed data
as a function of the parameters in the statistical model that we assume generated it.
We estimate the parameters in the model by choosing them to maximize this likelihood;
computationally,
it is often easier to minimize the negative log likelihood function.
Moreno-Sánchez, Font-Clos, and Corral (\protect\hyperlink{ref-More2016}{2016}) define the likelihood using a parameter \(\beta\),
which is related to the \(\alpha\) parameter in our definition of Zipf's Law
through \(\alpha = \tfrac{1}{\beta-1}\).
Under their model,
the value of \(c\) is the total number of unique words,
or equivalently the largest value of the rank.

Expressed as a Python function,
the negative log likelihood function is:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ numpy }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ np}


\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ nlog_likelihood(beta, counts):}
    \CommentTok{"""Log-likelihood function."""}
\NormalTok{    likelihood }\OperatorTok{=} \OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{ np.}\BuiltInTok{sum}\NormalTok{(np.log((}\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{counts)}\OperatorTok{**}\NormalTok{(beta }\OperatorTok{-} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}
                          \OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{ (}\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{(counts }\OperatorTok{+} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{))}\OperatorTok{**}\NormalTok{(beta }\OperatorTok{-} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)))}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ likelihood}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Obtaining an estimate of \(\beta\) (and thus \(\alpha\))
then becomes a numerical optimization problem,
for which we can use the \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html}{\texttt{scipy.optimize}} library.
Again following Moreno-Sánchez, Font-Clos, and Corral (\protect\hyperlink{ref-More2016}{2016}),
we use Brent's Method with \(1 < \beta \leq 4\).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

We can then plot the fitted curve on the plot axes (\texttt{ax})
defined in the \texttt{plotcounts.py} script:

We can then run the script to obtain the \(\alpha\) value for \emph{Dracula}
and a new plot with a line fitted.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/plotcounts.py results/dracula.csv --outfile}
  \ExtensionTok{results/dracula.png}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
alpha: 1.0866646252515038
\end{verbatim}

So according to our fit,
the most frequent word will occur approximately \(2^{1.1}=2.1\) times
as often as the second most frequent word,
\(3^{1.1}=3.3\) times as often as the third most frequent word, and so on.
Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-dracula-fit} shows the plot.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-advanced/dracula-fit} 

}

\caption{Word frequency distribution for Dracula.}\label{fig:git-advanced-dracula-fit}
\end{figure}

The script appears to be working as we'd like,
so we can go ahead and commit our changes to the \texttt{fit} development branch:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ add bin/plotcounts.py results/dracula.png}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ commit -m }\StringTok{"Added fit to word count data"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[fit 3ff8195] Added fit to word count data
 2 files changed, 62 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
\end{verbatim}

If we look at the last couple of commits using \texttt{git\ log},
we see our most recent change:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ log --oneline -n 2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
3ff8195 Added fit to word count data
ffb5cee adding ignore file
\end{verbatim}

(We use \texttt{-\/-oneline} and \texttt{-n~2} to shorten the log display.)
But if we switch back to the \texttt{master} branch:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ checkout master}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ branch}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
* master
  fit
\end{verbatim}

and look at the log,
our change is not there:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ log --oneline -n 2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
ffb5cee adding ignore file
d77bc5c Update dracula plot
\end{verbatim}

We have not lost our work:
it just isn't included in this branch.
We can prove this by switching back to the \texttt{fit} branch and checking the log again:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ checkout fit}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ log --oneline -n 2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
3ff8195 Added fit to word count data
d77bc5c Update dracula plot
\end{verbatim}

We can also look inside \texttt{plotcounts.py} and see our changes.
If we make another change and commit it,
that change will also go into the \texttt{fit} branch.
For instance,
we could add some additional information to one of our docstrings
to make it clear what equations were used in estimating \(\alpha\).

\textbf{Why Branch?}

Why go to all this trouble?
Imagine we are in the middle of debugging a change like this
when we are asked to make final revisions
to a paper that was created using the old code.
If we revert \texttt{plotcount.py} to its previous state we might lose our changes.
If instead we have been doing the work on a branch,
we can switch branches,
create the plot,
and switch back in complete safety.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{git-advanced-merge}{%
\section{Merging}\label{git-advanced-merge}}

We could proceed in three ways at this point:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Add our changes to \texttt{plotcounts.py} once again in the \texttt{master} branch.
\item
  Stop working in \texttt{master} and start using the \texttt{fit} branch for future development.
\item
  \gref{Merge}{git\_merge} the \texttt{fit} and \texttt{master} branches.
\end{enumerate}

The first option is tedious and error-prone;
the second will lead to a bewildering proliferation of branches,
but the third option is simple, fast, and reliable.\index{Git commands!merge}\index{merge (in Git)}
To start,
let's make sure we're in the \texttt{master} branch:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ checkout master}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ branch}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
  fit
* master
\end{verbatim}

We can now merge the changes in the \texttt{fit} branch into our current branch
with a single command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ merge fit}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Updating d77bc5c..db1d03f
Fast-forward
 bin/plotcounts.py   |  76 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                           ++++++++++++++++++++++-
 results/dracula.png | Bin 22351 -> 31378 bytes
 2 files changed, 75 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
\end{verbatim}

Merging doesn't change the source branch \texttt{fit},
but once the merge is done,
all of the changes made in \texttt{fit} are also in the history of \texttt{master}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ log --oneline -n 4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
db1d03f (HEAD -> master, fit) Adding Moreno-Sanchez et al (2016) reference
3ff8195 Added fit to word count data
ffb5cee adding ignore file
d77bc5c Update dracula plot
\end{verbatim}

Note that Git automatically creates a new commit (in this case, \texttt{db1d03f})
to represent the merge.
If we now run \texttt{git\ diff\ master..fit},
Git doesn't print anything
because there aren't any differences to show.

Now that we have merged all of the changes from \texttt{fit} into \texttt{master}
there is no need to keep the \texttt{fit} branch,
so we can delete it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ branch -d fit}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Deleted branch fit (was db1d03f).
\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Not Just the Command Line}

We have been creating, merging, and deleting branches on the command line,
but we can do all of these things using \href{https://www.gitkraken.com/}{GitKraken},
\href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/}{the RStudio IDE},
and other GUIs.
The operations stay the same;
all that changes is how we tell the computer what we want to do.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{git-advanced-conflict}{%
\section{Handling Conflicts}\label{git-advanced-conflict}}

A \gref{conflict}{git\_conflict} occurs\index{Git!conflict}\index{conflict!in Git}
when a line has been changed in different ways in two separate branches
or when a file has been deleted in one branch but edited in the other.
Merging \texttt{fit} into \texttt{master} went smoothly
because there were no conflicts between the two branches,
but if we are going to use branches,
we must learn how to merge conflicts.

To start,
let's add a \texttt{README.md} file to the \texttt{master} branch
containing just the project's title:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{nano}\NormalTok{ README.md}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cat}\NormalTok{ README.md}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# Zipf's Law
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ add README.md}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ commit -m }\StringTok{"Initial commit of README file"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[master b07c14a] Initial commit of README file
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
\end{verbatim}

Now let's create a new development branch called \texttt{docs}
to work on improving the documentation for our code.
We will use \texttt{git\ checkout\ -b} to create a new branch and switch to it
in a single step:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ checkout -b docs}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Switched to a new branch 'docs'
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ branch}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
* docs
  master
\end{verbatim}

On this new branch,
let's add some information to the README file:

\begin{verbatim}
# Zipf's Law

These Zipf's Law scripts tally the occurrences of words in text files
and plot each word's rank versus its frequency.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ add README.md}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ commit -m }\StringTok{"Added repository overview"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[docs a41a6ea] Added repository overview
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
\end{verbatim}

In order to create a conflict,
let's switch back to the \texttt{master} branch.
The changes we made in the \texttt{docs} branch are not present:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ checkout master}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Switched to branch 'master'
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cat}\NormalTok{ README.md}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# Zipf's Law
\end{verbatim}

Let's add some information about the contributors to our work:

\begin{verbatim}
# Zipf's Law

## Contributors

- Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "Added contributor list"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
[master a102c83] Added contributor list
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
\end{verbatim}

We now have two branches,
\texttt{master} and \texttt{docs},
in which we have changed \texttt{README.md} in different ways:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ diff docs..master}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{diff --git a/README.md b/README.md}
\NormalTok{index fd3de28..cf317ea 100644}
\DataTypeTok{--- a/README.md}
\DataTypeTok{+++ b/README.md}
\DataTypeTok{@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@}
\NormalTok{ # Zipf's Law}

\StringTok{-These Zipf's Law scripts tally the occurrences of words in text files}
\StringTok{-and plot each word's rank versus its frequency.}
\VariableTok{+## Contributors}
\VariableTok{+}
\VariableTok{+- Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When we try to merge \texttt{docs} into \texttt{master},
Git doesn't know which of these changes to keep:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ merge docs master}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
\end{verbatim}

If we look in \texttt{README.md},
we see that Git has kept both sets of changes,
but has marked which came from where:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cat}\NormalTok{ README.md}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# Zipf's Law

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Contributors

- Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
=======
These Zipf's Law scripts tally the occurrences of words in text files
and plot each word's rank versus its frequency.
>>>>>>> docs
\end{verbatim}

The lines from \texttt{\textless{}\textless{}\textless{}\textless{}\textless{}\textless{}\textless{}~HEAD} to \texttt{=======} are what was in \texttt{master},
while the lines from there to \texttt{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}\textgreater{}\textgreater{}\textgreater{}\textgreater{}\textgreater{}~docs} show what was in \texttt{docs}.
If there were several conflicting regions in the same file,
Git would mark each one this way.

We have to decide what to do next:\index{Git!resolve conflict}\index{resolve conflict (in Git)}
keep the \texttt{master} changes,
keep those from \texttt{docs},
edit this part of the file to combine them,
or write something new.
Whatever we do,
we must remove the \texttt{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}\textgreater{}}, \texttt{===}, and \texttt{\textless{}\textless{}\textless{}} markers.
Let's combine the two sets of changes:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{nano}\NormalTok{ README.md}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cat}\NormalTok{ README.md}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# Zipf's Law

These Zipf's Law scripts tally the occurrences of words in text files
and plot each word's rank versus its frequency.

## Contributors

- Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
\end{verbatim}

We can now add the file and commit the change,
just as we would after any other edit:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ add README.md}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ commit -m }\StringTok{"Merging README additions"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[master 4ffeaa4] Merging README additions
\end{verbatim}

Our branch's history now shows a single sequence of commits,
with the \texttt{master} changes on top of the earlier \texttt{docs} changes:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ log --oneline -n 4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
4ffeaa4 (HEAD -> master) Merging README additions
a102c83 Added contributors list
a41a6ea (docs) Added repository overview
b07c14a Initial commit of README file
\end{verbatim}

If we want to see what really happened,
we can add the \texttt{-\/-graph} option to \texttt{git\ log}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ log --oneline --graph -n 4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
*   4ffeaa4 (HEAD -> master) Merging README additions
|\
| * a41a6ea (docs) Added repository overview
* | a102c83 Added contributors list
|/
* b07c14a Initial commit of README file
\end{verbatim}

At this point we can delete the \texttt{docs} branch:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ branch -d docs}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Deleted branch docs (was 4ffeaa4).
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively,
we can keep using \texttt{docs} for documentation updates.
Each time we switch to it,
we merge changes \emph{from} \texttt{master} \emph{into} \texttt{docs},
do our editing
(while switching back to \texttt{master} or other branches as needed
to work on the code),
and then merge \emph{from} \texttt{docs} \emph{to} \texttt{master}
once the documentation is updated.

\hypertarget{git-advanced-workflow}{%
\section{A Branch-Based Workflow}\label{git-advanced-workflow}}

What is the best way to incorporate branching into our regular coding practice?
If we are working on our own computer,
this workflow will help us keep track of what we are doing:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \texttt{git\ checkout\ master} to make sure we are in the \texttt{master} branch.
\item
  \texttt{git\ checkout\ -b\ name-of-feature} to create a new branch.
  We \emph{always} create a branch when making changes,
  since we never know what else might come up.
  The branch name should be as descriptive as a variable name or filename would be.
\item
  Make our changes.
  If something occurs to us along the way---for example,
  if we are writing a new function and realize that
  the documentation for some other function should be updated---we do \emph{not}
  do that work in this branch just because we happen to be there.
  Instead,
  we commit our changes,
  switch back to \texttt{master},
  and create a new branch for the other work.
\item
  When the new feature is complete,
  we \texttt{git\ merge\ master\ name-of-feature}
  to get any changes we merged into \texttt{master} after creating \texttt{name-of-feature}
  and resolve any conflicts.
  This is an important step:
  we want to do the merge and test that everything still works in our feature branch,
  not in \texttt{master}.
\item
  Finally,
  we switch back to \texttt{master} and \texttt{git\ merge\ name-of-feature\ master}
  to merge our changes into \texttt{master}.
  We should not have any conflicts,
  and all of our tests should pass.
\end{enumerate}

Most experienced developers use this
\gref{branch-per-feature workflow}{branch\_per\_feature\_workflow},\index{branch-per-feature workflow (in Git)}\index{Git!branch-per-feature workflow}
but what exactly is a \enquote{feature}?
These rules make sense for small projects:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Anything cosmetic that is only one or two lines long
  can be done in \texttt{master} and committed right away.
  Here,
  \enquote{cosmetic} means changes to comments or documentation:
  nothing that affects how code runs, not even a simple variable renaming.
\item
  A pure addition that doesn't change anything else is a feature and goes into a branch.
  For example,
  if we run a new analysis and save the results,
  that should be done on its own branch
  because it might take several tries to get the analysis to run,
  and we might interrupt ourselves to fix things that we discover aren't working.
\item
  Every change to code that someone might want to undo later in one step is a feature.
  For example,
  if a new parameter is added to a function,
  then every call to the function has to be updated.
  Since neither alteration makes sense without the other,
  those changes are considered a single feature and should be done in one branch.
\end{enumerate}

The hardest thing about using a branch-per-feature workflow is sticking to it for small changes.
As the first point in the list above suggests,
most people are pragmatic about this on small projects;
on large ones,
where dozens of people might be committing,
even the smallest and most innocuous change needs to be in its own branch
so that it can be reviewed (which we discuss below).

\hypertarget{git-advanced-fork}{%
\section{Using Other People's Work}\label{git-advanced-fork}}

So far we have used Git to manage individual work,
but it really comes into its own when we are working with other people.
We can do this in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Everyone has read and write access to a single shared repository.
\item
  Everyone can read from the project's main repository,
  but only a few people can commit changes to it.
  The project's other contributors \gref{fork}{git\_fork} the main repository\index{Git!fork a repository}\index{fork (in Git)}
  to create one that they own,
  do their work in that,
  and then submit their changes to the main repository.
\end{enumerate}

The first approach works well for teams of up to half a dozen people
who are all comfortable using Git,
but if the project is larger,
or if contributors are worried that they might make a mess in the \texttt{master} branch,
the second approach is safer.

Git itself doesn't have any notion of a \enquote{main repository},
but \gref{forges}{forge} like \href{https://github.com}{GitHub},
\href{https://gitlab.com/}{GitLab},
and \href{https://bitbucket.org/}{BitBucket} all encourage people
to use Git in ways that effectively create one.
Suppose,
for example,
that Sami wants to contribute to the Zipf's Law code that
Amira is hosting on GitHub at \texttt{https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf}.
Sami can go to that URL and click on the \enquote{Fork} button in the upper right corner
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-fork-button}).
GitHub immediately creates a copy of Amira's repository within Sami's account on GitHub's own servers.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-advanced/fork-button} 

}

\caption{Forking a repository.}\label{fig:git-advanced-fork-button}
\end{figure}

When the command completes,
the setup on GitHub now looks like Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-after-fork}.
Nothing has happened yet on Sami's own machine:
the new repository exists only on GitHub.
When Sami explores its history,
they see that it contains all of the changes Amira made.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-advanced/after-fork} 

}

\caption{Repositories on GitHub after forking.}\label{fig:git-advanced-after-fork}
\end{figure}

A copy of a repository is called a \gref{clone}{git\_clone}.\index{Git!clone a repository}\index{clone (in Git)}
In order to start working on the project,
Sami needs a clone of \emph{their} repository (not Amira's) on their own computer.
We will modify Sami's prompt to include their desktop user ID (\texttt{sami})
and working directory (initially \texttt{\textasciitilde{}})
to make it easier to follow what's happening:\index{Git commands!clone}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{sami}\NormalTok{:~ $ git clone https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Cloning into 'zipf'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 60, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (60/60), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (42/42), done.
remote: Total 60 (delta 17), reused 59 (delta 16), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (60/60), done.
\end{verbatim}

This command creates a new directory with the same name as the project,
i.e., \texttt{zipf}.
When Sami goes into this directory and runs \texttt{ls} and \texttt{git\ log},
they see that all of the project's files and history are there:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{sami}\NormalTok{:~ $ cd zipf}
\ExtensionTok{sami}\NormalTok{:~/zipf $ ls}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
README.md       bin             data             results
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{sami}\NormalTok{:~/zipf $ git log --oneline -n 4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
4ffeaa4 (HEAD -> master) Merging README additions
a102c83 Added contributors list
a41a6ea Added repository overview
b07c14a Initial commit of README file
\end{verbatim}

Sami also sees that Git has automatically created a \gref{remote}{git\_remote} for their repository\index{Git!remote}\index{remote (in Git)}
that points back at their repository on GitHub:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{sami}\NormalTok{:~/zipf $ git remote -v}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
origin  https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git (push)
\end{verbatim}

Sami can pull changes from their fork and push work back there,
but needs to do one more thing before getting the changes from Amira's repository:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{sami}\NormalTok{:~/zipf $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git}
\ExtensionTok{sami}\NormalTok{:~/zipf $ git remote -v}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
origin      https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git (fetch)
origin      https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git (push)
upstream    https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git (fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git (push)
\end{verbatim}

Sami has called their new remote \texttt{upstream} because it points at the repository
theirs is derived from.\index{Git!upstream repository}\index{upstream repository (in Git)}
They could use any name,
but \texttt{upstream} is a nearly universal convention.

With this remote in place,
Sami is finally set up.
Suppose,
for example,
that Amira has modified the project's \texttt{README.md} file to add Sami as a contributor.
(Again, we show Amira's user ID and working directory in her prompt to make it clear who's doing what).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{amira}\NormalTok{:~/zipf $ pwd}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
/Users/amira/zipf
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{amira}\NormalTok{:~/zipf $ nano README.md}
\ExtensionTok{amira}\NormalTok{:~/zipf $ cat README.md}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Amira commits her changes and pushes them to \emph{her} repository on GitHub:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

Amira's changes are now on her desktop and in her GitHub repository
but not in either of Sami's repositories (local or remote).
Since Sami has created a remote that points at Amira's GitHub repository,
though,
they can easily pull those changes to their desktop:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{sami}\NormalTok{:~/zipf $ git pull upstream master}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

Pulling from a repository owned by someone else
is no different than pulling from a repository we own.
In either case,
Git merges the changes and asks us to resolve any conflicts that arise.
The only significant difference is that,
as with \texttt{git\ push} and \texttt{git\ pull},
we have to specify both a remote and a branch:
in this case,
\texttt{upstream} and \texttt{master}.

\hypertarget{git-advanced-pull-requests}{%
\section{Pull Requests}\label{git-advanced-pull-requests}}

Sami can now get Amira's work,
but how can Amira get Sami's?
She could create a remote that pointed at Sami's repository on GitHub
and periodically pull in Sami's changes,
but that would lead to chaos,
since we could never be sure that everyone's work was in any one place at the same time.
Instead,
almost everyone uses \gref{pull requests}{pull\_request}.\index{pull request (in Git)}\index{Git!pull request}
They aren't part of Git itself,
but are supported by all major online \gref{forges}{forge}.

A pull request is essentially a note saying,
\enquote{Someone would like to merge branch A of repository B into branch X of repository Y}.
The pull request does not contain the changes,
but instead points at two particular branches.
That way,
the difference displayed is always up to date
if either branch changes.

But a pull request can store more than just the source and destination branches:
it can also store comments people have made about the proposed merge.
Users can comment on the pull request as a whole,
or on particular lines,
and mark comments as out of date
if the author of the pull request updates the code that the comment is attached to.
Complex changes can go through several rounds of review and revision
before being merged,
which makes pull requests the review system we all wish journals actually had.

To see this in action,
suppose Sami wants to add their email address to \texttt{README.md}.
They create a new branch and switch to it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{sami}\NormalTok{:~/zipf $ git checkout -b adding-email}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Switched to a new branch 'adding-email'
\end{verbatim}

then make a change and commit it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{sami}\NormalTok{:~/zipf $ nano README.md}
\ExtensionTok{sami}\NormalTok{:~/zipf $ git commit -a -m }\StringTok{"Adding my email address"}

Sami's changes are only in their local repository.
They cannot create a pull request until those changes are on GitHub,
so they push their new branch to their repository on GitHub:

\end{verbatim}

When Sami goes to their GitHub repository in the browser,
GitHub notices that they have just pushed a new branch
and asks them if they want to create a pull request
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-after-sami-pushes}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-advanced/after-sami-pushes} 

}

\caption{Repository state after Sami pushes.}\label{fig:git-advanced-after-sami-pushes}
\end{figure}

When Sami clicks on the button,
GitHub displays a page showing the default source and destination of the pull request
and a pair of editable boxes for the pull request's title and a longer comment
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-start}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-advanced/open-pull-request} 

}

\caption{Starting a pull request.}\label{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-start}
\end{figure}

If they scroll down,
Sami can see a summary of the changes that will be in the pull request
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-summary}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-advanced/open-pull-request-detail}

\caption{Summary of a pull request.}\label{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-summary}

The top (title) box is autofilled with the previous commit message,
so Sami adds an extended explanation to provide additional context
before clicking on \enquote{Create Pull Request}
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-fill-in}).
When they do,
GitHub displays a page showing the new pull request,
which has a unique serial number
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-new}).
Note that this pull request is displayed in Amira's repository rather than Sami's
since it is Amira's repository that will be affected if the pull request is merged.

Some time later,
Amira checks her repository and sees that there is a pull request
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-viewing}).
Clicking on the \enquote{Pull requests} tab brings up a list of PRs
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-list})
and clicking on the pull request link itself displays its details
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-details}),
Which appears identical to the details seen by .

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-advanced/pr-details} 

}

\caption{Details of pull requests.}\label{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-details}
\end{figure}

Since there are no conflicts,
GitHub will let Amira merge the PR immediately using the \enquote{Merge pull request} button.
She could also discard or reject it without merging using the \enquote{Close pull request} button.
Instead,
she clicks on the \enquote{Files changed} tab to see what Sami has changed
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-changes}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-advanced/pr-changes} 

}

\caption{Viewing changes to files.}\label{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-changes}
\end{figure}

If she moves her mouse over particular lines,\index{Git!pull request!reviewing}\index{reviewing (Git pull request})\index{code review!pull request}
a white-on-blue cross appears near the numbers to indicate that she can add comments
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-comment-marker}).
She clicks on the marker beside her own name and writes a comment:
She only wants to make one comment rather than write a lengthier multi-comment review,
so she chooses \enquote{Add single comment}
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-write-comment}).
GitHub redisplays the page with her remarks inserted
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-pr-with-comment}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-advanced/pr-comment-marker}

}

\caption{Viewing a comment on a pull request.}\label{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-pr-with-comment}
\end{figure}

While Amira is working,
GitHub has been emailing notifications to both Sami and Amira.
When Sami clicks on the link in their email notification,
it takes them to the PR and shows Amira's comment.
Sami changes \texttt{README.md},
commits,
and pushes,
but does \emph{not} create a new pull request or do anything to the existing one.\index{Git!pull request!updating}
As explained above,
a PR is a note asking that two branches be merged,
so if either end of the merge changes,
the PR updates automatically.

Sure enough,
when Amira looks at the PR again a few moments later she sees Sami's changes
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-pr-with-fix}).
Satisfied,
she goes back to the \enquote{Conversation} tab and clicks on \enquote{Merge}.
The icon at the top of the PR's page changes text and color to show that the merge was successful
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-successful-merge}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-advanced/pr-with-fix}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-advanced/pr-successful-merge} 

}

\caption{After a successful merge.}\label{fig:git-advanced-pull-request-successful-merge}
\end{figure}

To get those changes from GitHub to her desktop repository,
Amira uses \texttt{git\ pull}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{amira}\NormalTok{:~/zipf $ git pull origin master}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

To get the change they just made from their \texttt{adding-email} branch into their \texttt{master} branch,
Sami could use \texttt{git\ merge} on the command line.
It's a little clearer,
though,
if they also use \texttt{git\ pull} from their \texttt{upstream} repository (i.e., Amira's repository)
so that they're sure to get any other changes that Amira may have merged:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

All four repositories are now synchronized.

\hypertarget{git-advanced-pr-conflict}{%
\section{Handling Conflicts in Pull Requests}\label{git-advanced-pr-conflict}}

Finally,
suppose that Amira and Sami have decided to collaborate more extensively on this project.
Amira has added Sami as a collaborator to the GitHub repository.
Now Sami can make contributions directly to the repository,
rather than via a pull request from a forked repository.

Sami makes a change to \texttt{README.md} in the \texttt{master} branch on GitHub.
Meanwhile, Amira is making a conflicting change to the same file in a different branch.\index{Git!pull request!conflict}
When Amira creates her pull request,
GitHub will detect the conflict and report that the PR cannot be merged automatically
(Figure~\ref{fig:git-advanced-pr-conflict}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/git-advanced/pr-conflict} 

}

\caption{Showing a conflict in a pull request.}\label{fig:git-advanced-pr-conflict}
\end{figure}

Amira can solve this problem with the tools she already has.
If she has made her changes in a branch called \texttt{editing-readme},
the steps are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Pull Sami's on the \texttt{master} branch of the GitHub repository
  into the \texttt{master} branch of her desktop repository.
\item
  Merge \emph{from} the \texttt{master} branch of her desktop repository
  \emph{to} the \texttt{editing-readme} branch in the same repository.
\item
  Push her updated \texttt{editing-readme} branch to her repository on GitHub.
  The pull request from there back to the \texttt{master} branch of the main repository
  will update automatically.
\end{enumerate}

GitHub and other forges do allow people to merge conflicts
through their browser-based interfaces,
but doing it on our desktop means we can use our favorite editor to resolve the conflict.
It also means that if the change affects the project's code,
we can run everything to make sure it still works.

But what if Sami or someone else merges another change
while Amira is resolving this one,
so that by the time she pushes to her repository
there is another, different, conflict?
In theory this cycle could go on forever;
in practice,
it reveals a communication problem that Amira (or someone) needs to address.
If two or more people are constantly making incompatible changes to the same files,
they should discuss who's supposed to be doing what,
or rearrange the project's contents so that they aren't stepping on each other's toes.

\hypertarget{git-advanced-summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{git-advanced-summary}}

Branches and pull requests seem complicated at first,
but they quickly become second nature.
Everyone involved in the project can work at their own pace on what they want to,
picking up others' changes and submitting their own whenever they want.
More importantly,
this workflow gives everyone has a chance to review each other's work.
As we discuss in Section~\ref{style-review},
doing reviews doesn't just prevent errors from creeping in:
it is also an effective way to spread understanding and skills.

  to the \texttt{master} branch of Chartreuse's repository on GitHub.
\item
  Chartreuse does \emph{not} merge Fuchsia's PR.
  Instead,
  they add a file \texttt{chartreuse.txt} to the \texttt{master} branch of their desktop repository
  and push that change to their repository on GitHub.
\item
  Fuchsia adds a remote to their desktop repository called \texttt{upstream}
  that points at Chartreuse's repository on GitHub
  and runs \texttt{git\ pull\ upstream\ master},
  then merges any changes or conflicts.
\item
  Fuchsia pushes from the \texttt{master} branch of their desktop repository

\begin{quote}
Evil begins when you begin to treat people as things.

--- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}
\end{quote}

Projects can run for years with poorly-written code,
but none will survive for long if people are confused,
pulling in different directions,
or hostile to each other.
This chapter therefore looks at how to create a culture of collaboration
that will help people who want to contribute to your project,
and introduce a few ways to manage projects and teams as they develop.
Our recommendations draw on Fogel (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Foge2005}{2005}),
which describes how good open source software projects are run,
and on Bollier (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Boll2014}{2014}),
which explains what a \gref{commons}{commons} is\index{commons}
and when it's the right model to use.

At this point,
the Zipf's Law project should include:

\begin{verbatim}

    ├── dracula.csv
    ├── dracula.png
    └── ...
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{teams-scope}{%
\section{What is a Project?}\label{teams-scope}}

The first decision we have to make is what exactly constitutes a \enquote{project} (Wilson et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wils2017}{2017}).
Some examples are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A dataset that is being used by several research projects.
  The project includes the raw data,
  the programs used to tidy that data,
  the tidied data,
  the extra files needed to make the dataset a package,
  and a few text files describing the data's authors, license, and \gref{provenance}{provenance}.
\item
  A set of annual reports written for an \gref{NGO}{ngo}.
  The project includes several Jupyter notebooks,
  some supporting Python libraries used by those notebooks,
  copies of the HTML and PDF versions of the reports,
  a text file containing links to the datasets used in the report
  (which can't be stored on GitHub since they contain personal identifying information),
  and a text file explaining details of the analysis that the authors didn't include in the reports themselves.
\item
  A software library that provides an interactive glossary of data science terms in both Python and R.
  The project contains the files needed to create a package in both languages,
  a Markdown file full of terms and definitions,
  and a Makefile with targets to check cross-references, compile packages, and so on.
\end{itemize}

Some common criteria for creating projects are one per publication,\index{project!scope}
one per deliverable piece of software,
or one per team.
The first tends to be too small:
a good dataset will result in several reports,
and the goal of some projects is to produce a steady stream of reports (such as monthly forecasts).
The second is a good fit for software engineering projects
whose primary aim is to produce tools rather than results,
but can be an awkward fit for data analysis work.
The third tends to be too large:
a team of half a dozen people may work on many different things at once,
and a repository that holds them all quickly looks like someone's basement.

One way to decide what makes up a project is to ask what people have meetings about.
If the same group needs to get together on a regular basis to talk about something,
that \enquote{something} probably deserves its own repository.
And if the list of people changes slowly over time but the meetings continue,
that's an even stronger sign.

\hypertarget{teams-inclusive}{%
\section{Include Everyone}\label{teams-inclusive}}

Most research software projects begin as the work of one person,
who may continue to do the bulk of the coding and data analysis throughout its existence (Majumder et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Maju2019}{2019}).
As projects become larger,
though,
they eventually need more contributors to sustain them.
Involving more people also improves the functionality and robustness of the code,
since newcomers bring their own expertise or see old problems in new ways.

In order to leverage a group's expertise,
a project must do more than \emph{allow} people to contribute:
its leaders must communicate that the project \emph{wants} contributions,
and that newcomers are welcome and valued (Sholler et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Shol2019}{2019}).\index{project!inclusivity}\index{inclusivity}
Saying \enquote{the door is open} is not enough:
many potential contributors have painful personal experience of being less welcome than others.
In order to create a truly welcoming environment for everyone,
the project must explicitly acknowledge that some people are treated unfairly
and actively take steps to remedy this.
Doing this increases diversity within the team,
which makes it more productive (Zhang \protect\hyperlink{ref-Zhan2020}{2020}).
More importantly,
it is the right thing to do.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Terminology}

\gref{Privilege}{privilege} is an unearned advantage given to some people but not all,\index{privilege}
while \gref{oppression}{oppression} is systemic inequality that benefits the privileged\index{oppression}
and harms those without privilege (Aurora and Gardiner \protect\hyperlink{ref-Auro2018}{2018}).
In Europe, the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand,
a straight, white, affluent, physically able male
is less likely to be interrupted when speaking,
more likely to be called on in class,
and more likely to get a job interview based on an identical CV
than someone who is outside these categories.
People who are privileged are often not aware of it,
as they've lived in a system that provides unearned advantages their entire lives.
In John Scalzi's memorable phrase,
they've been playing on the lowest difficulty setting there is
their whole lives,
and as a result don't realize how much harder things are for others (Scalzi \protect\hyperlink{ref-Scal2012}{2012}).

The targets of oppression are often called \enquote{members of a marginalized group},
but targets don't choose to be marginalized:
people with privilege marginalize them.
Finally,
an \gref{ally}{ally} is a member of a privileged group\index{ally}
who is working to understand their own privilege and end oppression.
\end{quote}

Encouraging inclusivity is a shared responsibility.
If we are privileged,
we should educate ourselves and call out peers who are marginalizing others,
even if (or especially if) they aren't conscious of doing it.
As project leaders,
part of our job is to teach contributors how to be allies
and to ensure an inclusive culture (Lee \protect\hyperlink{ref-Lee1962}{1962}).

\hypertarget{teams-coc}{%
\section{Establish a Code of Conduct}\label{teams-coc}}

The starting point for making a project more inclusive is
to establish a Code of Conduct.\index{Code of Conduct (for project)}\index{project!Code of Conduct}
This does four things:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  It promotes fairness within a group.
\item
  It reassures members of marginalized groups
  who have experienced harassment or unwelcoming behavior before
  that this project takes inclusion seriously.
\item
  It ensures that everyone knows what the rules are.
  (This is particularly important when people come from different cultural backgrounds.)
\item
  It prevents anyone who misbehaves from pretending that
  they didn't know what they did was unacceptable.
\end{enumerate}

More generally,
a Code of Conduct makes it easier for people to contribute
by reducing uncertainty about what behaviors are acceptable.
Some people may push back claiming that it's unnecessary,
or that it infringes freedom of speech,
but what they usually mean is that
thinking about how they might have benefited from past inequity makes them feel uncomfortable.
If having a Code of Conduct leads to them going elsewhere,
that will probably make the project run more smoothly.

By convention,
we add a Code of Conduct to our project
by creating a file called \texttt{CONDUCT.md} in the project's root directory.\index{project files!CONDUCT}
Writing a Code of Conduct that is both comprehensive and readable is hard.
We therefore recommend using one that other groups have drafted, refined, and tested.
The \href{https://www.contributor-covenant.org}{Contributor Covenant} is relevant for projects being developed online,
such as those based on GitHub:

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make
participation in our community a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open,
welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment
for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and
  experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by
  our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but
  for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention
  or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or
  political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or
  email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered
  inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing
our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate
and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove,
edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and
other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct,
and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when
appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and
also applies when an individual is officially representing the
community in public spaces. Examples of representing our
community include using an official e-mail address, posting via
an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable
behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for
enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. All complaints will be
reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and
security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines
in determining the consequences for any action they deem in
violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other
behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community
leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and
an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public
apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or
series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued
behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including
unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct,
for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding
interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary
or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards,
including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or
public communication with the community for a specified period of
time. No public or private interaction with the people involved,
including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code
of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms
may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of
community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,
harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or
disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public
interaction within the community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the
[Contributor Covenant][covenant],
version 2.0, available at
https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.

Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by
[Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement
ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).

For answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see
the FAQ at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq. Translations

\end{verbatim}

As you can see,
the Contributor Covenant defines expectations for behavior,
the consequences of non-compliance,
and the mechanics of reporting and handling violations.
The third part is as important as the first two,
since rules are meaningless without a method to enforce them;
Aurora and Gardiner (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Auro2018}{2018}) is a short, practical guide that every project lead should read.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{In-Person Events}

The Contributor Covenant works well for interactions that are largely online,
which is the case for many research software projects.
The best option for in-person events is
the \href{https://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy}{model Code of Conduct} from the \href{https://geekfeminism.wikia.com/}{Geek Feminism Wiki},
which is used by many open source organizations and conferences.
If your project is sited at a university or within a company,
it may already have Code of Conduct:
the Human Resources department is usually the most helpful place to ask.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{teams-license}{%
\section{Include a License}\label{teams-license}}

While a Code of Conduct describes how contributors should interact with each other,
a license dictates how project materials can be used and redistributed.
If the license or a publication agreement makes it difficult for people to contribute,
the project is less likely to attract new members,\index{project!license}
so the choice of license is crucial to the project's long-term sustainability.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Open Except\ldots{}}

Projects that are only developing software may not have any problem making everything open.
Teams working with sensitive data, on the other hand,
must be careful to ensure that what should be private isn't inadvertently shared.
In particular,
people who are new to Git (and even people who aren't)
occasionally add raw data files containing personal identifying information to repositories.
It's possible to rewrite the project's history to remove things when this happens,
but that doesn't automatically erase copies people may have in forked repositories.
\end{quote}

Every creative work has some sort of license;
the only question is whether authors and users know what it is and choose to enforce it.
Choosing a license for a project can be complex,
not least because the law hasn't kept up with everyday practice.
Morin, Urban, and Sliz (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mori2012}{2012}) and VanderPlas (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Vand2014}{2014}) are good starting points
to understand licensing and intellectual property from a researcher's point of view,
while Lindberg (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lind2008}{2008}) is a deeper dive for those who want details.
Depending on country, institution, and job role,
most creative works are automatically eligible for intellectual property protection.
However,
members of the team may have different levels of copyright protection.
For example,
students and faculty may have a copyright on the research work they produce,
but university staff members may not,
since their employment agreement may state that
what they create on the job belongs to their employer.

To avoid legal messiness,
every project should include an explicit license.
This license should be chosen early,
since changing a license can be complicated.
For example,
each collaborator may hold copyright on their work
and therefore need to be asked for approval when a license is changed.
Similarly,
changing a license does not change it retroactively,
so different users may wind up operating under different licensing structures.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Leave It To The Professionals}

Don't write your own license.
Legalese is a highly technical language,
and words don't mean what you think they do.
\end{quote}

To make license selection for code as easy as possible,
GitHub allows us to select one of several common software licenses when creating a repository.
The Open Source Initiative maintains \href{https://opensource.org/licenses}{a list} of \gref{open licenses}{open\_license},
and \href{https://choosealicense.com/}{choosealicense.com} will help us find a license that suits our needs.
Some of the things we need to think about are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Do we want to license the work at all?
\item
  Is the content we are licensing source code?
\item
  Do we require people distributing derivative works to also distribute their code?
\item
  Do we want to address patent rights?
\item
  Is our license compatible with the licenses of the software we depend on?
\item
  Do our institutions have any policies that may overrule our choices?
\item
  Are there any copyright experts within our institution who can assist us?
\end{enumerate}

Unfortunately,
GitHub's list does not include common licenses for data or written works like papers and reports.
Those can be added in manually,
but it's often hard to understand the interactions between multiple licenses
on different kinds of material (Almeida et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Alme2017}{2017}).

Just as the project's Code of Conduct is usually placed in a root-level file called \texttt{CONDUCT.md},
its license is usually put in a file called \texttt{LICENSE.md}\index{project files!LICENSE}
that is also in the project's root directory.

\hypertarget{teams-license-software}{%
\subsection{Software}\label{teams-license-software}}

In order to choose the right license for our software,
we need to understand the difference between two kinds of license.\index{open source license}
The \gref{MIT License}{mit\_license}\index{MIT License}\index{open source license!MIT License}
(and its close sibling the BSD License)\index{BSD License}\index{open source license!BSD License}
say that people can do whatever they want to with the software as long as they cite the original source,
and that the authors accept no responsibility if things go wrong.
The \gref{GNU Public License}{gpl} (GPL)\index{GNU Public License (GPL)}\index{GPL (GNU Public License)}\index{open source license!GPL}
gives people similar rights,
but requires them to share their own work on the same terms:

\begin{quote}
You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files.
Any modifications to or software including (via compiler) GPL-licensed code
must also be made available under the GPL
along with build and install instructions.

--- \href{https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)}{tl;dr}
\end{quote}

In other words,
if someone modifies GPL-licensed software or incorporates it into their own project,
and then distributes what they have created,
they have to distribute the source code for their own work as well.

The GPL was created to prevent companies from taking advantage of open software
without contributing anything back.
The last thirty years have shown that this restriction isn't necessary:
many projects have survived and thrived without this safeguard.
We therefore recommend that projects choose the MIT license,
as it places the fewest restrictions on future action.

\textbf{First, Do No Harm}

The \href{https://firstdonoharm.dev/}{Hippocratic License}\index{Hippocratic License}\index{open source license!Hippocratic License}
is a newer license
that is quickly becoming popular.
Where the GPL requires people to share their work,
the Hippocratic License requires them to do no harm.
More precisely,
it forbids people from using the software in ways that violate
the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights}{Universal Declaration of Human Rights}.
We have learned the hard way that software and science can be mis-used;
adopting the Hippocratic License is a small step toward preventing this.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{teams-license-other}{%
\subsection{Data and reports}\label{teams-license-other}}

The MIT license, the GPL, and the Hippocratic License are intended for use with software.
When it comes to data and reports,
the most widely used family of licenses are those produced
by \href{https://creativecommons.org/}{Creative Commons}.\index{Creative Commons}
These have been written and checked by lawyers and are well understood by the community.

The most liberal option is referred to as \gref{CC-0}{cc\_license},\index{Creative Commons!CC-0 license}\index{public domain}
where the \enquote{0} stands for \enquote{zero restrictions}.
This puts work in the public domain,
i.e.,
allows anyone who wants to use it to do so however they want with no restrictions.
CC-0 is usually the best choice for data,
since it simplifies aggregate analysis involving datasets from different sources.
It does not negate the scholarly tradition and requirement of citing sources;
it just doesn't make it a legal requirement.

The next step up from CC-0 is the Creative Commons--Attribution license,
usually referred to as \gref{CC-BY}{cc\_license}.\index{Creative Commons!CC-BY license}\index{CC-BY license}
This allows people to do whatever they want to with the work
as long as they cite the original source.
This is the best license to use for manuscripts:
we want people to share them widely
but also want to get credit for our work.

Other Creative Commons licenses incorporate various restrictions,
and are usually referred two using the two-letter abbreviations listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ND (no derivative works) prevents people from creating modified versions of our work.
  Unfortunately, this also inhibits translation and reformatting.
\item
  SA (share-alike) requires people to share work that incorporates ours
  on the same terms that we used.
  Again,
  it is fine in principle but in practice makes aggregation and recombination difficult.
\item
  NC (no commercial use) does \emph{not} mean that people cannot charge money for something that includes our work,
  though some publishers still try to imply that in order to scare people away from open licensing.
  Instead,
  the NC clause means that people cannot charge for something that uses our work without our explicit permission,
  which we can give under whatever terms we want.
\end{itemize}

To apply these concepts to our Zipf's Law project,
we need to consider both our data (which other people created)
and our results (which we create).
We can view the license for the novels by looking in \texttt{data/README.md},
which tells us that the Gutenberg Project books are in the public domain (i.e., CC-0).
This is a good choice for our results as well,
but after reflection,
we decide to choose CC-BY for our papers
so that everyone can read them (and cite them).

\hypertarget{teams-planning}{%
\section{Planning}\label{teams-planning}}

Codes of conduct and licenses are a project's constitution,
but how do contributors know what they should actually be doing on any given day?
Whether we are working by ourselves or with a group of people,
the best way to manage this is to use an \gref{issue tracking system}{issue\_tracking\_system}
to keep track of tasks we need to complete or problems we need to fix.
\gref{Issues}{issue} are sometimes called \gref{tickets}{ticket},\index{project!issue}\index{issue (in project)}
so issue tracking systems are sometimes called \gref{ticketing systems}{ticketing\_system}.\index{issue tracking system}
They are also often called \gref{bug trackers}{bug\_tracker},
but they can be used to manage any kind of work,
and are often a convenient way to manage discussions as well.

Like other \gref{forges}{forge},
GitHub allows participants to create issues for a project,
comment on existing issues,
and search all available issues.
Every issue can hold:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A unique ID, such as \texttt{\#123}, which is also part of its URL.
  This makes issues easy to find and refer to:
  GitHub automatically turns the expression \texttt{\#123} in a \gref{commit message}{commit\_message}
  into a link to that issue.
\item
  A one-line title to aid browsing and search.
\item
  The issue's current status.
  In simple systems (like GitHub's) each issue is either open or closed,
  and by default,
  only open issues are displayed.
  Closed items are generally removed from default interfaces,
  so issues should only be closed when they no longer require any attention.
\item
  The user ID of the issue's creator.
  Just as \texttt{\#123} refers to a particular issue,
  \texttt{@name} is automatically translated into a link to that person.
  The IDs of people who have commented on it or modified it are embedded in the issue's history,
  which helps figure out who to talk to about what.
\item
  The user ID of the person assigned to review the issue, if someone is assigned.
\item
  A full description that may include screenshots,
  error messages,
  and anything else that can be put in a web page.
\item
  Replies, counter-replies, and so on from people who are interested in the issue.
\end{itemize}

Broadly speaking,
people create three kinds of issues:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \gref{Bug reports}{bug\_report} to describe problems they have encountered.\index{bug report}
\item
  \gref{Feature requests}{feature\_request}\index{feature request}
  describing what could be done next,
  such as \enquote{add this function to this package} or \enquote{add a menu to the website}.
\item
  Questions about how to use the software,
  how parts of the project work,
  or its future directions.
  These can eventually turn into bug reports or feature requests,
  and can often be recycled as documentation.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Helping Users Find Information}

Many projects encourage people to ask questions on a mailing list or in a chat channel.
However,
answers given there can be hard to find later,
which leads to the same questions coming up over and over again.
If people can be persuaded to ask questions by filing issues,
and to respond to issues of this kind,
then the project's old issues become a customized \href{https://stackoverflow.com/}{Stack Overflow} for the project.
Some projects go so far as to create a page of links
to old questions and answers that are particularly helpful.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{teams-bugs}{%
\section{Bug Reports}\label{teams-bugs}}

One steady supply of work in any active project is \gref{bug reports}{bug\_report}.
Unsurprisingly,
a well-written bug report is more likely to get a fast response\index{bug report!style}
that actually addresses the problem (Bettenburg et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bett2008}{2008}).
To write a good bug report:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Make sure the problem actually \emph{is} a bug.
  It's always possible that we have called a function the wrong way
  or done an analysis using the wrong configuration file.
  If we take a minute to double-check,
  or ask someone else on our team to check our logic,
  we could well fix the problem ourselves.
\item
  Try to come up with a \gref{reproducible example}{reprex}
  or \enquote{reprex}\index{reproducible example (reprex)}\index{reprex (reproducible example)}
  that includes only the steps needed to make the problem happen,
  and that (if possible) uses simplified data rather than a complete dataset.
  Again,
  we can often we solve the problem ourselves as we trim down the steps to create one.
\item
  Write a one-line title for the issue
  and a longer (but still brief) description that includes relevant details.
\item
  Attach any screenshots that show the problem,
  resulting errors,
  or (slimmed-down) input files needed to re-create it.
\item
  Describe the version of the software we were using,
  the operating system we were running on,
  which version of the programming language we ran it with,
  and anything else that might affect behavior.
  If the software in question uses a logging framework (Section~\ref{errors-logging}),
  turn debugging output on and include it with the issue.
\item
  Describe each problem separately so that each one can be tackled on its own.
  This parallels the rule about creating a branch in version control for each bug fix or feature
  discussed in Section~\ref{git-advanced}.
\end{enumerate}

Here is an example of a well-written bug report with all of the components mentioned above:

\begin{verbatim}
ID: #25
Creator: @sami
Owner: @amira
Title: countwords.py does not handle em-dashes correctly
Description:

1.  Create a text file called 'emdash.txt' containing the single
    line "first---second".

2.  Run 'python bin/countwords.py emdash.txt'

The program should find the words 'first' and 'second', but
instead it finds the single "word" 'first---second'.

Versions:
-   Tested in `809b6768`.
-   Using on Windows 10.
-   Python 3.6.7 installed from anaconda
\end{verbatim}

It takes time and energy to write a good error report.
If the report is being filed by a member of the development team,
the incentive to document errors well is that resolving the issue later is easier.
You can encourage users from outside the project to write thorough error reports
by including an issue template for your project.
An issue template is a file included in your GitHub repository
that proliferates each new issue with text that describes expectations
for content that should be submitted.
You can't force new issues to be as complete as you might like,
but you can use an issue template to make it easier for contributors to
remember and complete documentation about bug reports.

Sometimes the person creating the issue may not know or have the right answer for some of these things,
and will be doing their best with limited information about the error.
Responding with kindness and encouragement is important to maintain a healthy community,
and should be enforced by the project's Code of Conduct\index{Code of Conduct (for project)}
(Section~\ref{teams-coc}).

\hypertarget{teams-labels}{%
\section{Labeling Issues}\label{teams-labels}}

The bigger or older a project gets,
the harder it is to find things---unless, that is,
the project's members put in a bit of work to make things findable (Lin, Ali, and Wilson, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Lin2020}{n.d.}).
Issue trackers let project members add \gref{labels}{issue\_label} to issues\index{issue (in project)!label}
to make things easier to search and organize.
Labels are also often called \gref{tags}{tag};\index{tags (for issues in project)}
whatever term is used,
each one is just a descriptive word or two.

GitHub allows project owners to define any labels they want.
A small project should always use some variation on these three:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Bug}: something should work but doesn't.
\item
  \emph{Enhancement}: something that someone wants added to the software.
\item
  \emph{Task}: something needs to be done, but won't show up in code
  (e.g., organizing the next team meeting).
\end{itemize}

Projects also often use:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Question}: where is something
  or how is something supposed to work?
  As noted above,
  issues with this label can often be recycled as documentation.
\item
  \emph{Discussion} or \emph{Proposal}: something the team needs to make a decision about
  or a concrete proposal to resolve such a discussion.
  All issues can have discussion:
  this category is for issues that start that way.
  (Issues that are initially labeled \emph{Question}
  are often relabeled \emph{Discussion} or \emph{Proposal}
  after some back and forth.)
\item
  \emph{Suitable for Newcomer} or \emph{Beginner-Friendly}:
  to identify an easy starting point for someone who has just joined the project.
  If we help potential new contributors find places to start,
  they are more likely to do so (Steinmacher et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Stei2014}{2014}).
\end{itemize}

The labels listed above identify the kind of work an issue describes.
A separate set of labels can be used to indicate the state of an issue:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Urgent}: work needs to be done right away.
  (This label is typically reserved for security fixes).
\item
  \emph{Current}: this issue is included in the current round of work.
\item
  \emph{Next}: this issue is (probably) going to be included in the next round.
\item
  \emph{Eventually}: someone has looked at the issue and believes it needs to be tackled,
  but there's no immediate plan to do it.
\item
  \emph{Won't Fix}: someone has decided that the issue isn't going to be addressed,
  either because it's out of scope or because it's not actually a bug.
  Once an issue has been marked this way,
  it is usually then closed.
  When this happens,
  send the issue's creator a note explaining why the issue won't be addressed
  and encourage them to continue working with the project.
\item
  \emph{Duplicate}: this issue is a duplicate of one that's already in the system.
  Issues marked this way are usually also then closed;
  this is another opportunity to encourage people to stay involved.
\end{itemize}

Some projects use labels corresponding to upcoming software releases, journal issues, or conferences
instead of \emph{Current}, \emph{Next}, and \emph{Eventually}.
This approach works well in the short-term,
but becomes unwieldy as labels with names like \texttt{sprint-2020-08-01} and \texttt{spring-2020-08-16} pile up.

Instead,
a project team will usually create a \gref{milestone}{milestone},\index{milestone (in project)}\index{project!milestone}
which is a set of issues and pull requests in a single project repository.
GitHub milestones can have a due date
and display aggregate progress toward completion,
so the team can easily see when work is due and how much is left to be done.
Teams can also create projects,
which can include issues and pull requests from several repositories
as well as notes and reminders for miscellaneous tasks.

\hypertarget{teams-workflow}{%
\subsection{Standardizing workflows}\label{teams-workflow}}

Adding labels to issues also helps us standardize a workflow for the project.
Conventions about who can do what to issues with various labels,
and who can change those labels,
let us define a workflow like the one shown in Figure~\ref{fig:teams-lifecycle}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/teams/lifecycle} 

}

\caption{Example of issue lifecycle.}\label{fig:teams-lifecycle}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  An \emph{Open} issue becomes \emph{Assigned} when someone is made responsible for it.
\item
  They can then move the issue to \emph{Cancelled} if they think it was filed mistakenly
  or doesn't need to be fixed.
  (This is different from closing the issue after working on it.)
\item
  An \emph{Assigned} issue becomes \emph{Active} when someone starts to work on it.
\item
  When work is done it becomes \emph{Ready for Review}.
\item
  From there it is either \emph{Assigned} again because it needs more work
  or moved to \emph{Fixed},
  which means the change is ready to be incorporated into the project.
\item
  When the change is actually merged,
  the issue's state is changed to reflect that.
\end{itemize}

Small projects do not need this much formality,
but when the team is distributed
contributors need to be able to find out what's going on
without having to wait for someone to respond to email
(or wondering who they \emph{should} have emailed).

\hypertarget{teams-prioritize}{%
\section{Prioritizing}\label{teams-prioritize}}

Between bug reports, feature requests, and general cleanup,
there is always more work to do than time to do it,
so every project needs some way to figure out what to focus on.
Labeling issues helps with \gref{triage}{triage},\index{triage (issues of project)}\index{project!triage (issues)}
which is the process of deciding what is a priority and what isn't.
This is never an easy job for software projects
that need to balance fixing bugs with creating new features,
and is even more challenging for research projects
for which \enquote{done} is hard to define
or whose team members are widely distributed
or do not all work for the same institution.

Many commercial and open source teams have adopted
\gref{agile development}{agile} as a solution to these problems.\index{agile development}
Instead of carefully formulating long-term plans that could be derailed by changing circumstances,
agile development uses a sequence of short development
\gref{sprints}{sprint},\index{sprint (of agile development)}\index{agile development!sprint}
each typically one or two weeks long.
Each sprint starts with a planning session lasting one or two hours
in which the successes and failures of the previous sprint are reviewed
and issues to be resolved in the current sprint are selected.
If team members believe an issue is likely to take longer than a single sprint to complete,
it should be broken into smaller pieces that \emph{can} be finished
so that the team can track progress more accurately.
(Something large can be \enquote{90\% done} for weeks;
with smaller items,
it's easier to see how much headway is being made.)

To decide which issues to work on in the next sprint,
a team can construct an \gref{impact/effort matrix}{impact\_effort\_matrix}\index{impact/effort matrix}
(Figure~\ref{fig:teams-impact-effort}).
Impact measures how important the issue is to reaching the team's goals,
and is typically measured on a low--medium--high scale.
(Some teams use ratings from 1 to 10,
but this just leads to arguing over whether something is a 4 or a 5.)
Effort measures how much work the issue requires.
Since this can't always be estimated accurately,
it's common to classify things as \enquote{an hour}, \enquote{a day}, or \enquote{multiple days}.
Again,
anything that's likely to take longer than multiple days should be broken down
so that planning and progress tracking can be more accurate.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/teams/effort-impact-matrix} 

}

\caption{An impact/effort matrix.}\label{fig:teams-impact-effort}
\end{figure}

The impact/effort matrix makes the priorities for the coming sprint clear:
anything that is of high importance and requires little effort should be included,
while things of low importance that require a lot of effort should not.
The team must still make hard decisions, though:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Should a a single large high-priority item be done,
  or should several smaller low-priority items be tackled instead?
\item
  What should be done about medium-priority items that keep being put off?
\end{itemize}

Each team has to answer these questions for each sprint,
but that begs the question of exactly who has the final say in answering them.
In a large project,
a \gref{product manager}{product\_manager} decides how important items are,\index{product manager}\index{project!product manager}
while a \gref{project manager}{project\_manager} is responsible for estimating effort\index{project manager}\index{project!project manager}
and tracking progress.
In a typical research software projects,
the principal investigator either makes the decision
or delegates that responsibility (and authority) to the lead developer.

Regardless of who is ultimately responsible,
it is essential to include project participants in the planning and decision making.
This may be as simple as having them add \gref{up-votes}{up\_vote}\index{up-vote}
and \gref{down-votes}{down\_vote}\index{down-vote} to issues
to indicate their opinions on importance,
or as complex as asking them to propose
a multi-sprint breakdown of a particularly complex feature.
Doing this shows people that their contributions are valued,
which in turn increase their commitment to doing the work.
It also produces better plans,
since everyone knows something that someone else doesn't.

\hypertarget{teams-meetings}{%
\section{Meetings}\label{teams-meetings}}

Pull requests and GitHub issues are good tools for asynchronous work,
but team meetings are often a more efficient way to make decisions,
and help build a sense of community.
Knowing how to run a meeting well\index{project!meetings}\index{meetings!how to run}
is as important as knowing how to use version control;
the rules doing so are simple but rarely followed:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Decide if there actually needs to be a meeting.]
If the only purpose is to share information,
have everyone send a brief email instead.
Remember, people can read faster than they can speak:
if someone has facts for the rest of the team to absorb,
the most polite way to communicate them is to type them in.
\item[Write an agenda.]
If nobody cares enough about the meeting to prepare a point-form list of what's to be discussed,
the meeting itself probably doesn't need to happen.
Note that \enquote{the agenda is all the open issues in our GitHub repo} doesn't count.
\item[Include timings in the agenda.]
Timings help prevent early items stealing time from later ones.
The first estimates with any new group are inevitably optimistic,
so we should revise them upward for subsequent meetings.
However,
we shouldn't have a second or third meeting just because the first one ran over-time:
instead, we should try to figure out \emph{why} we're running over and fix the underlying problem.
\item[Prioritize.]
Tackle issues that will have high impact but take little time first,
and things that will take more time but have less impact later.
That way, if the first things run over time,
the meeting will still have accomplished something.
\item[Make one person responsible for keeping things moving.]
One person should be made moderator
and be responsible for keeping items to time,
chiding people who are having side conversations or checking email,
and asking people who are talking too much to get to the point.
The moderator should \emph{not} do all the talking:
in fact,
whoever is in charge will talk less in a well-run meeting than most other participants.
This should be a rotating duty among members.
\item[Require politeness.]
No one gets to be rude,
no one gets to ramble,
and if someone goes off topic,
it's the moderator's job to say,
\enquote{Let's discuss that elsewhere.}
\item[No interruptions.]
Participants should raise a finger, hand,
put up a sticky note,
or make another well understood gesture to indicate
when they want to speak.
The moderator should keep track of who wants to speak and give them time in turn.
\item[No distractions.]
Side conversations make meetings less efficient because
nobody can actually pay attention to two things at once.
Similarly,
if someone is checking their email or texting a friend during a meeting,
it's a clear signal that they don't think the speaker or their work is important.
This doesn't mean a complete ban on technology---people may need accessibility aids,
or may be waiting for a call from a dependent---but by default,
phones should be face down and laptops should be closed
during in-person meetings.
\item[Take minutes.]
Someone other than the moderator should take point-form notes
about the most important information that was shared,
and about every decision that was made or every task that was assigned to someone.
This should be a rotating duty among members.
\item[End early.]
If the meeting is scheduled for 10:00--11:00,
aim to end at 10:50 to give people a break before whatever they're doing next.
\end{description}

As soon as the meeting is over,
circulate the minutes by emailing them to everyone\index{project!meeting minutes}\index{meetings!minutes}
or adding a text file to the project's repository:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[People who weren't at the meeting can keep track of what's going on.]
We all have to juggle tasks from several projects or courses,
which means that sometimes we can't make it to meetings.
Checking a written record
is a more accurate and efficient way to catch up than asking a colleague,
\enquote{So, what did I miss?}
\item[Everyone can check what was actually said or promised.]
More than once,
one of us has looked over the minutes of a meeting and thought,
\enquote{Did I say that?} or,
\enquote{I didn't promise to have it ready then!}
Accidentally or not,
people will often remember things differently;
writing them down gives everyone a chance to correct mistakes,
misinterpretations,
or misrepresentations.
\item[People can be held accountable at subsequent meetings.]
There's no point making lists of questions and action items
if we don't follow up on them later.
If we are using an issue-tracking system,
we should create a ticket for each new question or task right after the meeting
and update those that are being carried forward.
This helps a lot when the time comes to draw up the agenda for the next meeting.
\end{description}

\hypertarget{teams-fair}{%
\subsection{Air time}\label{teams-fair}}

One of the problem in a synchronous meeting
is the tendency of some people to speak far more than others.
Other meeting members may be so accustomed to this
that they don't speak up even when they have valuable points to make.\index{meetings!how to run}

One way to combat this is to give everyone \gref{three sticky notes}{three\_stickies}
at the start of the meeting.
Every time they speak,
they have to give up one sticky note.
When they're out of stickies,
they aren't allowed to speak until everyone has used at least one,
at which point everyone gets all of their sticky notes back.
This ensures that nobody talks more than three times as often as
the quietest person in the meeting,
and completely changes group dynamics.
People who have given up trying to be heard
suddenly have space to contribute,
and the overly-frequent speakers realize how unfair they have been.

Another useful technique is called \gref{interruption bingo}{interruption\_bingo}.
Draw a grid and label the rows and columns with the participants' names.
Each time one person interrupts another,
add a tally mark to the appropriate cell;
halfway through the meeting,
take a moment to look at the results.
In most cases it will be clear that
one or two people are doing all of the interrupting.
After that, saying, \enquote{All right, I'm adding another tally to the bingo card,}
is often enough to get them to throttle back.

\hypertarget{teams-online}{%
\subsection{Online meetings}\label{teams-online}}

Online meetings provide special challenges,\index{meetings!online}
both in the context of regulating how often individuals speak,
as well as running meetings in general.
Troy (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Troy2018}{2018}) discusses why online meetings are often frustrating and unproductive and
points out that in most online meetings,
the first person to speak during a pause gets the floor.
As a result,
\enquote{If you have something you want to say,
you have to stop listening to the person currently speaking
and instead focus on when they're gonna pause or finish
so you can leap into that nanosecond of silence and be the first to utter something.
The format\ldots encourages participants who want to contribute
to say more and listen less.}

The solution is to run a text chat beside the video conference
where people can signal that they want to speak.
The moderator can then select people from the waiting list.
This practice can be reinforced by having everyone mute themselves,
and only allowing the moderator to unmute people.
Brookfield and Preskill (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Broo2016}{2016}) has many other useful suggestions for managing meetings.

\hypertarget{teams-martha}{%
\section{Making Decisions}\label{teams-martha}}

The purpose of a well-run meeting is to make decisions,
so sooner or later,
the members of a project must decide who has a say in what.
The first step is to acknowledge that every team has a power structure:
the question is whether it's formal or informal---in other words,
whether it's accountable or unaccountable (Freeman \protect\hyperlink{ref-Free1972}{1972}).
The latter can work for groups of up to half a dozen people
in which everyone knows everyone else.
Beyond that,
groups need to spell out
who has the authority to make which decisions
and how to achieve consensus.
In short,
they need explicit \gref{governance}{governance}.\index{governance!project}\index{project!governance}

\gref{Martha's Rules}{marthas\_rules} are a practical way to do this\index{Martha's Rules}\index{governance!Martha's Rules}
in groups of up to a few dozen members (Minahan \protect\hyperlink{ref-Mina1986}{1986}):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Before each meeting, anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal.
  Proposals must be filed at least 24 hours before a meeting
  in order to be considered at that meeting, and must include:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a one-line summary
  \item
    the full text of the proposal
  \item
    any required background information
  \item
    pros and cons
  \item
    possible alternatives
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A quorum is established in a meeting if half or more of voting members are present.
\item
  Once a person has sponsored a proposal, they are responsible for it.
  The group may not discuss or vote on the issue unless the sponsor or their delegate is present.
  The sponsor is also responsible for presenting the item to the group.
\item
  After the sponsor presents the proposal,
  a \gref{sense vote}{sense\_vote} is cast for the proposal prior to any discussion:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Who likes the proposal?
  \item
    Who can live with the proposal?
  \item
    Who is uncomfortable with the proposal?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If all of the group likes or can live with the proposal,
  it passes with no further discussion.
\item
  If most of the group is uncomfortable with the proposal,
  it is sent back to its sponsor for further work.
  (The sponsor may decide to drop it if it's clear that
  the majority isn't going to support it.)
\item
  If some members are uncomfortable with the proposal,
  a timer is set for a brief discussion moderated by the meeting moderator.
  After 10 minutes or when no one has anything further to add,
  the moderator calls for a straight yes-or-no vote on the question:
  \enquote{Should we implement this decision over the stated objections?}
  If a majority votes \enquote{yes} the proposal is implemented.
  Otherwise, it is returned to the sponsor for further work.
\end{enumerate}

Every group that uses Martha's Rules must make two procedural decisions:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[How are proposals put forward?]
In a software development project,
the easiest way is to file an issue in the project's GitHub repository
tagged \emph{Proposal},
or to create a pull request containing a single file
with the text of the proposal.
Team members can then comment on the proposal,
and the sponsor can revise it
before bringing it to a vote.
\item[Who gets to vote?]
The usual answer is \enquote{whoever is working on the project,}
but as it attracts more volunteer contributors,
a more explicit rule is needed.
One common method is for existing members to nominate new ones,
who are then voted on using the process described above.
\end{description}

\hypertarget{teams-documentation}{%
\section{Make All This Obvious to Newcomers}\label{teams-documentation}}

Rules that people don't know about can't help them.
Once your team agrees on a project structure,
a workflow,
how to get items on a meeting agenda,
or how to make decisions,
you should therefore take the time to document this for newcomers.
This information may be included as sections in the existing \texttt{README} file\index{project files!README}
or put into files of their own:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{CONTRIBUTING}\index{project files!CONTRIBUTING}
  explains how to contribute,
  i.e.,
  what naming conventions to use for functions,
  what tags to put on issues (Section~\ref{teams-planning}),
  or how to install and configure the software needed to start work on the project.
  These instructions can also be included as a section in \texttt{README};
  wherever they go,
  remember that the easier it is for people to get set up and contribute,
  the more likely they are to do so (Steinmacher et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Stei2014}{2014}).
\item
  \texttt{GOVERNANCE}\index{project files!GOVERNANCE}
  explains how the project is run (Section~\ref{teams-martha}).
  It is still uncommon for this to be in a file of its own---it is more often included
  in \texttt{README} or \texttt{CONTRIBUTING}---but open communities have learned the hard way
  that \emph{not} being explicit about who has a voice in decisions
  and how contributors can tell what decisions have been made
  causes trouble sooner or later.
\end{itemize}

Having these files helps new contributors orient themselves,
and also signals that the project is well run.

\hypertarget{teams-conflict}{%
\section{Handling Conflict}\label{teams-conflict}}

You just missed an important deadline,
and people are unhappy.
The sick feeling in the pit of your stomach has turned to anger:
you did \emph{your} part,
but Sylvie didn't finish her stuff until the very last minute,
which meant that no one else had time to spot the two big mistakes she'd made.
As for Cho,
he didn't deliver at all---again.
If something doesn't change,
contributors are going to start looking for a new project.

Conflicts like this come up all the time.\index{conflict!in teams}
Broadly speaking, there are four ways we can deal with them:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Cross our fingers and hope that things will get better on their own,
  even though they didn't the last three times.
\item
  Do extra work to make up for others' shortcomings.
  This saves us the mental anguish of confronting others in the short run,
  but the time for that \enquote{extra} has to come from somewhere.
  Sooner or alter,
  our personal lives or other parts of the project will suffer.
\item
  Lose our temper.
  People often wind up displacing anger into other parts of their life:
  they may yell at someone for taking an extra thirty seconds to make change
  when what they really need to do is tell their boss
  that they won't work through another holiday weekend
  to make up for management's decision to short-staff the project.
\item
  Take constructive steps to fix the underlying problem.
\end{enumerate}

Most of us find the first three options easiest,
even though they don't actually fix the problem.
The fourth option is harder because we don't like confrontation.
If we manage it properly,
though,
it is a lot less bruising,
which means that we don't have to be as afraid of initiating it.
Also,
if people believe that we will take steps when they bully, lie, procrastinate, or do a half-assed job,
they will usually avoid making it necessary.

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Make sure we are not guilty of the same sin.]
We won't get very far complaining about someone else interrupting in meetings
if we do it just as frequently.
\item[Check expectations.]
Are we sure the offender knows what standards they are supposed to be meeting?
This is where things like job descriptions
or up-front discussion of who's responsible for what
come in handy.
\item[Check the situation.]
Is someone dealing with an ailing parent or immigration woes?
Have they been put to work on three other projects that we don't know about?
Use open questions like, \enquote{Can you help me understand this?} when checking in.
This gives them the freedom to explain something you may not have expected,
and avoids the pressure of being asked directly about something they don't want to explain.
\item[Document the offense.]
Write down what the offender has actually done and why it's not good enough.
Doing this helps us clarify what we're upset about
and is absolutely necessary if we have to escalate.
\item[Check with other team members.]
Are we alone in feeling that the offender is letting the team down?
If so, we aren't necessarily wrong,
but it'll be a lot easier to fix things if we have the support of the rest of the team.
Finding out who else on the team is unhappy can be the hardest part of the whole process,
since we can't even ask the question without letting on that we are upset
and word will almost certainly get back to whoever we are asking about,
who might then accuse us of stirring up trouble.
\item[Talk with the offender.]
This should be a team effort:
put it on the agenda for a team meeting,
present the complaint,
and make sure that the offender understands it.
This is often enough:
if someone realizes that they're going to be called on their hitchhiking or bad manners,
they will usually change their ways.
\item[Escalate as soon as there's a second offense.]
People who don't have good intentions
count on us giving them one last chance after another
until the project is finished and they can go suck the life out of their next victim.
\emph{Don't fall into this trap.}
If someone stole a laptop, we would report it right away.
If someone steals time,
we are being foolish if we give them a chance to do it again and again.
\end{description}

In academic research projects,
\enquote{escalation} means \enquote{taking the issue to the project's principal investigator}.
Of course,
the PI has probably had dozens of students complain to her over the years
about teammates not doing their share,
and it isn't uncommon to have both halves of a pair tell the supervisor that they're doing all the work.
(This is yet another reason to use version control:
it makes it easy to check who's actually written what.)
In order to get her to take us seriously and help us fix our problem,
we should send her an email signed by several people
that describes the problem and the steps we have already taken to resolve it.
Make sure the offender gets a copy as well,
and ask the supervisor to arrange a meeting to resolve the issue.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Hitchhikers}

\gref{Hitchhikers}{hitchhiker} who show up but never actually do anything
are particularly difficult to manage,
in part because they are usually very good at appearing reasonable.
They will nod as we present our case,
then say, \enquote{Well, yes, but\ldots{}} and list a bunch of minor exceptions
or cases where others on the team have also fallen short of expectations.
Having collaborator guidelines (Section~\ref{teams-coc})
and tracking progress (Section~\ref{teams-workflow})
are essential for handling them.
If we can't back up our complaint,
our supervisor will likely be left with the impression that the whole team is dysfunctional.
\end{quote}

What can we do if conflict becomes more personal and heated,
especially if it relates to violations of our Code of Conduct?
A few simple guidelines will go a long way:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Be short, simple, and firm.
\item
  Don't try to be funny.
  It almost always backfires, or will later be used against us.
\item
  Play for the audience.
  We probably won't change the person we are calling out,
  but we might change the minds or strengthen the resolve of people who are observing.
\item
  Pick our battles.
  We can't challenge everyone, every time,
  without exhausting ourselves and deafening our audience.
  An occasional sharp retort will be much more effective than constant criticism.
\item
  Don't shame or insult one group when trying to help another.
  For example,
  don't call someone stupid
  when what we really mean is that they're racist or homophobic.
\end{enumerate}

\href{https://captainawkward.com/}{Captain Awkward} has useful advice for discussions like these,
and \href{https://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Charles\%27_Rules_of_Argument}{Charles' Rules of Argument} are very useful online.

Finally,
it's important to recognize that good principles sometimes conflict.
For example,
consider this scenario:

\begin{quote}
A manager consistently uses male pronouns to refer to software and people of unknown gender.
When you tell them it makes you uncomfortable to treat maleness as the norm,
they say that male is the default gender in their first language
and you should be more considerate of people from other cultures.
\end{quote}

On the one hand,
we want to respect other people's cultures;
on the other hand,
we want to be inclusive of women.
In this case,
the manager's discomfort about changing pronouns
matters less than the career harm caused by them being exclusionary,
but many cases are not this clear cut.

\hypertarget{teams-summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{teams-summary}}

This chapter was the hardest in this book to write,
but is probably also the most important.
A project can survive bad code or stumbles with Git,
but not confusion and interpersonal conflict.
Collaboration and management become easier with practice,
and everything you learn from taking part in research software projects
will help other things you do as well.

  How would you handle each of these people if they were on your team?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Anna} thinks she knows more about every subject
  than everyone else on the team put together.
  No matter what you say, she'll correct you;
  no matter what you know, she knows better.
  If you keep track in team meetings of how often people interrupt one another,
  her score is usually higher than everyone else's put together.
\item
  \emph{Bao} is a contrarian:
  no matter what anyone says, he'll take the opposite side.
  This is healthy in small doses,
  but when Bao does it,
  there's always another objection lurking behind the first half dozen.
\item
  \emph{Frank} believes that knowledge is power.
  He enjoys knowing things that other people don't---or to be more accurate,
  he enjoys it when people know he knows things they don't.
  Frank can actually make things work,
  but when asked how he did it,
  he'll grin and say,
  \enquote{Oh, I'm sure you can figure it out.}
\item
  \emph{Hediyeh} is quiet.
  Very quiet.
  She never speaks up in meetings,
  even when she knows that what other people are saying is wrong.
  She might contribute to the mailing list,
  but she's very sensitive to criticism,
  and will always back down rather than defending her point of view.
\item
  \emph{Kenny} is a hitchhiker.
  He has discovered that most people would rather shoulder some extra work than snitch,
  and he takes advantage of it at every turn.
  The frustrating thing is that he's so damn \emph{plausible}
  when someone finally does confront him.
  \enquote{There have been mistakes on all sides,} he says,
  or,
  \enquote{Well, I think you're nit-picking.}
\item
  \emph{Melissa} would easily have made the varsity procrastination team
  if she'd bothered to show up to tryouts.
  She means well---she really does feel bad about letting people down---but
  somehow her tasks are never finished until the last possible moment.
  Of course, that means that everyone who is depending on her can't do their work until
  \emph{after} the last possible moment\ldots{}
\item
  \emph{Petra}'s favorite phrase is \enquote{why don't we}.
  Why don't we write a GUI to help people edit the program's configuration files?
  Hey, why don't we invent our own little language for designing GUIs?
\item
  \emph{Raj} is rude.
  \enquote{It's just the way I talk,} he says.
  \enquote{If you can't hack it, maybe you should find another team.}
  His favorite phrase is, \enquote{That's stupid,}
  and he uses obscenity in every second sentence.

\chapter{Automating Analyses with Make}\label{automate}}

\begin{quote}
The three rules of the Librarians of Time and Space are:
1) Silence;
2) Books must be returned no later than the last date shown; and
3) Do not interfere with the nature of causality.

--- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}
\end{quote}

It's easy to run one program to process a single data file,
but what happens when our analysis depends on many files,
or when we need to re-do the analysis every time new data arrives?
What should we do if the analysis has several steps
that we have to do in a particular order?

If we try to keep track of this ourselves
we will inevitably forget some crucial steps
and it will be hard for other people to pick up our work.
Instead,
we should use a \gref{build manager}{build\_manager}\index{build manager}
to keep track of what depends on what
and run our analysis programs automatically.
These tools were invented to help programmers compile complex software,
but can be used to automate any workflow.

Our Zipf's Law project currently includes these files:

\begin{verbatim}
zipf/
├── .gitignore
├── CONDUCT.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE.md
├── README.md
├── bin
│   ├── book_summary.sh
│   ├── collate.py
│   ├── countwords.py
│   ├── plotcounts.py
│   ├── script_template.py
│   └── utilities.py
├── data
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── dracula.txt
│   ├── frankenstein.txt
│   └── ...
└── results
    ├── dracula.csv
    ├── dracula.png
    └── ...
\end{verbatim}

Now that the project's main building blocks are in place,
we're ready to automate our analysis using a build manager.
We will use a program called \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/make/}{Make}\index{Make} to do this
so that every time we add a new book to our data,
we can create a new plot of the word count distribution with a single command.
Make works as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Every time the \gref{operating system}{operating\_system} creates, reads, or changes a file,
  it updates a \gref{timestamp}{timestamp}\index{timestamp} on the file to show when the operation took place.
  Make can compare these timestamps
  to figure out whether files are newer or older than one another.
\item
  A user can describe which files depend on each other
  by writing \gref{rules}{build\_rule}\index{build rule} in a \gref{Makefile}{makefile}.
  For example,
  one rule could say that \texttt{results/moby\_dick.csv} depends on \texttt{data/moby\_dick.txt},
  while another could say that the plot \texttt{results/comparison.png}
  depends on all of the CSV files in the \texttt{results} directory.
\item
  Each rule also tells Make how to update an out-of-date file.
  For example,
  the rule for \emph{Moby Dick} could tell Make to run \texttt{bin/countwords.py}
  if the result file is older than either the raw data file or the program.
\item
  When the user runs Make,
  the program checks all of the rules in the Makefile
  and runs the commands needed to update any that are out of date.
  If there are \gref{transitive dependencies}{transitive\_dependency}---i.e.,\index{build dependency}\index{dependency!in build}
  if A depends on B and B depends on C---then Make will trace them through
  and run all of the commands it needs to in the right order.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Keep Tracking With Version Control}

We learned about tracking our project's version history using Git
in Chapters~\ref{git-cmdline} and~\ref{git-advanced}.
We encourage you to continue apply the Git workflow
throughout the rest of our code development,
though we won't continue to remind you.

\hypertarget{automate-single-file}{%
\section{Updating a Single File}\label{automate-single-file}}

To start automating our analysis,
let's create a file called \texttt{Makefile} in the root of our project
and add the following:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Regenerate results for "Moby Dick"}
\DecValTok{results/moby_dick.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/moby_dick.txt}
\NormalTok{    python bin/countwords.py }\CharTok{\textbackslash{}}
\NormalTok{      data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As in the shell and many other programming languages,
\texttt{\#} indicates that the first line is a comment.
The second and third lines form a \gref{build rule}{build\_rule}:\index{build rule}
the \gref{target}{build\_target}\index{build target} of the rule is \texttt{results/moby\_dick.csv},
its single \gref{prerequisite}{prerequisite} is the file \texttt{data/moby\_dick.txt},
and the two are separated by a single colon \texttt{:}.
There is no limit on the length of statement lines in Makefiles,
but to aid readability we have used a backslash (\texttt{\textbackslash{}}) character to split
the lengthy third line in this example.

The target and prerequisite tell Make what depends on what.
The line below them describes the \gref{recipe}{build\_recipe}\index{build recipe}
that will update the target if it is out of date.
The recipe consists of one or more shell commands,
each of which \emph{must} be prefixed by a single tab character.
Spaces cannot be used instead of tabs here,
which can be confusing as they are interchangeable in most other programming languages.
In the rule above,
the recipe is \enquote{run \texttt{bin/countwords.py} on the raw data file
and put the output in a CSV file in the \texttt{results} directory}.

To test our rule, run this command in the shell:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Make automatically looks for a file called \texttt{Makefile},
follows the rules it contains,
and prints the commands that were executed.
In this case it displays:

\begin{verbatim}
python bin/countwords.py \
  data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv
\end{verbatim}

When Make follows the rules in our Makefile,
one of three things will happen:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If \texttt{results/moby\_dick.csv} doesn't exist,
  Make runs the recipe to create it.
\item
  If \texttt{data/moby\_dick.txt} is newer than \texttt{results/moby\_dick.csv},
  Make runs the recipe to update the results.
\item
  If \texttt{results/moby\_dick.csv} is newer than its prerequisite,
  Make does nothing.
\end{enumerate}

In the first two cases,
Make prints the commands it runs
along with anything those command prints to the screen
via \gref{standard output}{stdout} or \gref{standard error}{stderr}.
There is no screen output in this case,
so we only see the command.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Indentation Errors}

If a \texttt{Makefile} indents a rule with spaces rather than tabs,
Make produces an error message like this:

\begin{verbatim}
Makefile:3: *** missing separator.  Stop.
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

No matter what happened the first time we ran \texttt{make},
if we run it again right away it does nothing
because our rule's target is now up to date.
It tells us this by displaying the message:

\begin{verbatim}
make: `results/moby_dick.csv' is up to date.
\end{verbatim}

We can check that it is telling the truth by listing the files with their timestamps,
ordered by how recently they have been updated:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}\NormalTok{ -l -t data/moby_dick.txt results/moby_dick.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
-rw-r--r-- 1 amira staff  219107 31 Dec 08:58 results/moby_dick.csv
-rw-r--r-- 1 amira staff 1276201 31 Dec 08:58 data/moby_dick.txt
\end{verbatim}

As a further test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Delete \texttt{results/moby\_dick.csv} and run \texttt{make} again.
  This is case \#1, so Make runs the recipe.
\item
  Use \texttt{touch\ data/moby\_dick.txt} to update the timestamp on the data file,
  then run \texttt{make}.
  This is case \#2,
  so again,
  Make runs the recipe.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Managing Makefiles}

We don't have to call our file \texttt{Makefile}:
if we prefer something like \texttt{workflows.mk},
we can tell Make to read recipes from that file using
\texttt{make\ -f\ workflows.mk}.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{automate-multiple}{%
\section{Managing Multiple Files}\label{automate-multiple}}

Our Makefile documents exactly how to reproduce one specific result.
Let's add another rule to reproduce another result:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Regenerate results for "Moby Dick"}
\DecValTok{results/moby_dick.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/moby_dick.txt}
\NormalTok{    python bin/countwords.py }\CharTok{\textbackslash{}}
\NormalTok{      data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv}

\CommentTok{# Regenerate results for "Jane Eyre"}
\DecValTok{results/jane_eyre.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/jane_eyre.txt}
\NormalTok{    python bin/countwords.py }\CharTok{\textbackslash{}}
\NormalTok{      data/jane_eyre.txt > results/jane_eyre.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When we run \texttt{make} it tells us:

\begin{verbatim}
make: `results/moby_dick.csv' is up to date.
\end{verbatim}

By default Make only attempts to update the first target it finds in the Makefile,
which is called the \gref{default target}{default\_target}.\index{build target!default}
In this case,
the first target is \texttt{results/moby\_dick.csv},
which is already up to date.
To update something else,
we need to tell Make specifically what we want:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ results/jane_eyre.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
python bin/countwords.py \
  data/jane_eyre.txt > results/jane_eyre.csv
\end{verbatim}

If we have to run \texttt{make} once for each result
we're right back where we started.
However,
we can add a rule to our Makefile to update all of our results at once.
We do this by creating a \gref{phony target}{phony\_target}\index{build target!phony}
that doesn't correspond to an actual file.
Let's add this line to the top of our Makefile:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{all :}\DataTypeTok{ results/moby_dick.csv results/jane_eyre.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There is no file called \texttt{all},
and this rule doesn't have any recipes of its own,
but when we run \texttt{make\ all},
Make finds everything that \texttt{all} depends on,
then brings each of those prerequisites up to date (Figure~\ref{fig:automate-all}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/automate/make-dependency-graph} 

}

\caption{Dependency graph when making everything.}\label{fig:automate-all}
\end{figure}

The order in which rules appear in the Makefile
does not necessarily determine the order in which recipes are run.
Make is free to run commands in any order
so long as nothing is updated before its prerequisites are up to date.

We can use phony targets to automate and document other steps in our workflow.
For example,
let's add another target to our Makefile to delete all of the result files we have generated
so that we can start afresh.
By convention this target is called \texttt{clean},\index{build target!clean}
and ours looks like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Remove all generated files.}
\DecValTok{clean :}
\NormalTok{    rm -f results/*}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{-f} flag to \texttt{rm} means \enquote{force removal}:
if it is present,
\texttt{rm} won't complain if the files we have told it to remove are already gone.
If we now run:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ clean}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Make will delete any results files we have.
This is a lot safer than typing \texttt{rm\ -f\ results/*} at the command-line each time,
because if we mistakenly put a space before the \texttt{*}
we would delete all of the files in the project's root directory.

Phony targets are very useful,
but there is a catch.
Try doing this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mkdir}\NormalTok{ clean}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ clean}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
make: `clean' is up to date.
\end{verbatim}

Since there is a directory called \texttt{clean},
Make thinks the target \texttt{clean} in the Makefile refers to this directory.
Since the rule has no prerequisites,
it can't be out of date,
so no recipes are executed.

We can unconfuse Make by putting this line at the top of Makefile
to explicitly state which targets are phony:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OtherTok{.PHONY} \OtherTok{:}\DataTypeTok{ all clean}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{automate-depend-programs}{%
\section{Updating Files When Programs Change}\label{automate-depend-programs}}

Our current Makefile says that each result file depends on the corresponding data file.
That's not entirely true:
each result also depends on the program used to generate it.
If we change our program,
we should regenerate our results.
To get Make to do that,
we can add the program to the prerequisites for each result:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# ...phony targets...}

\CommentTok{# Regenerate results for "Moby Dick"}
\DecValTok{results/moby_dick.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/moby_dick.txt bin/countwords.py}
\NormalTok{    python bin/countwords.py }\CharTok{\textbackslash{}}
\NormalTok{      data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv}

\CommentTok{# Regenerate results for "Jane Eyre"}
\DecValTok{results/jane_eyre.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/jane_eyre.txt bin/countwords.py}
\NormalTok{    python bin/countwords.py }\CharTok{\textbackslash{}}
\NormalTok{      data/jane_eyre.txt > results/jane_eyre.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To run both of these rules,
we can type \texttt{make\ all}.
Alternatively,
since \texttt{all} is the first target in our Makefile,
Make will use it if we just type \texttt{make} on its own:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{touch}\NormalTok{ bin/countwords.py}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
python bin/countwords.py \
  data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv
python bin/countwords.py \
  data/jane_eyre.txt > results/jane_eyre.csv
\end{verbatim}

The exercises will explore how we can write a rule
to tell us whether our results will be different
after a change to a program
without actually updating them.
Rules like this can help us test our programs:
if we don't think an addition or modification ought to affect the results,
but it would,
we may have some debugging to do.

\hypertarget{automate-variables}{%
\section{Reducing Repetition in a Makefile}\label{automate-variables}}

Our Makefile now mentions \texttt{bin/countwords.py} four times.
If we ever change the name of the program or move it to a different location,
we will have to find and replace each of those occurrences.
More importantly,
this redundancy makes our Makefile harder to understand,
just as scattering \gref{magic numbers}{magic\_number} through programs
makes them harder to understand.

The solution is the same one we use in programs:
define and use variables.
Let's create names for the word-counting script and the command used to run it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# ...phony targets...}

\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{=}\StringTok{bin/countwords.py}
\DataTypeTok{RUN_COUNT}\CharTok{=}\StringTok{python }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}

\CommentTok{# Regenerate results for "Moby Dick"}
\DecValTok{results/moby_dick.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/moby_dick.txt }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RUN_COUNT}\CharTok{)}\NormalTok{ data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv}

\CommentTok{# Regenerate results for "Jane Eyre"}
\DecValTok{results/jane_eyre.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/jane_eyre.txt }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RUN_COUNT}\CharTok{)}\NormalTok{ data/jane_eyre.txt > results/jane_eyre.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Each definition takes the form \texttt{NAME=value}.
Variables are written in upper case by convention
so that they'll stand out from filenames
(which are usually in lower case),
but Make doesn't require this.
What \emph{is} required is using parentheses to refer to the variable,
i.e.,
to use \texttt{\$(NAME)} and not \texttt{\$NAME}.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Why the Parentheses?}

For historical reasons,
Make interprets \texttt{\$NAME} to be a \enquote{variable called \texttt{N} followed by the three characters \enquote{AME}},
If no variable called \texttt{N} exists,
\texttt{\$NAME} becomes \texttt{AME},
which is almost certainly not what we want.
\end{quote}

As in programs,
variables don't just cut down on typing.
They also tell readers that several things are always and exactly the same,
which reduces \gref{cognitive load}{cognitive\_load}.

\hypertarget{automate-autovar}{%
\section{Automatic Variables}\label{automate-autovar}}

We could add a third rule to analyze a third novel and a fourth to analyze a fourth,
but that won't scale to hundreds or thousands of novels.
Instead,
we can write a generic rule that does what we want for every one of our data files.

To do this,
we need to understand Make's
\gref{automatic variables}{automatic\_variable}.\index{automatic variables (in Make)}\index{Make!automatic variables}
The first step is to use the very cryptic expression \texttt{\$@} in the rule's recipe
to mean \enquote{the target of the rule}.
It lets us turn this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Regenerate results for "Moby Dick"}
\DecValTok{results/moby_dick.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/moby_dick.txt }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RUN_COUNT}\CharTok{)}\NormalTok{ data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

into this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Regenerate results for "Moby Dick"}
\DecValTok{results/moby_dick.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/moby_dick.txt }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RUN_COUNT}\CharTok{)}\NormalTok{ data/moby_dick.txt > }\CharTok{$@}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Make defines a value of \texttt{\$@} separately for each rule,
so it always refers to that rule's target.
And yes,
\texttt{\$@} is an unfortunate name:
something like \texttt{\$TARGET} would have been easier to understand,
but we're stuck with it now.

The next step is to replace the explicit list of prerequisites in the recipe
with the automatic variable \texttt{\$\^{}},
which means \enquote{all the prerequisites in the rule}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Regenerate results for "Jane Eyre"}
\DecValTok{results/moby_dick.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/moby_dick.txt }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RUN_COUNT}\CharTok{)} \CharTok{$^}\NormalTok{ > }\CharTok{$@}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However,
this doesn't work.
The rule's prerequisites are the novel and the word-counting program.
When Make expands the recipe,
the resulting command tries to process the program \texttt{bin/countwords.py}
as if it was a data file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/countwords.py \textbackslash{}}
\NormalTok{  data/moby_dick.txt bin/countwords.py }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ results/moby_dick.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Make solves this problem with another automatic variable \texttt{\$\textless{}},
which means \enquote{only the first prerequisite}.
Using it lets us rewrite our rule as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Regenerate results for "Jane Eyre"}
\DecValTok{results/moby_dick.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/moby_dick.txt }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RUN_COUNT}\CharTok{)} \CharTok{$<}\NormalTok{ > }\CharTok{$@}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{automate-pattern}{%
\section{Generic Rules}\label{automate-pattern}}

\texttt{\$\textless{}\ \textgreater{}\ \$@} is even harder to read than \texttt{\$@} on its own,
but we can now replace all the rules for generating results files
with one \gref{pattern rule}{pattern\_rule}\index{pattern rule}
using the \gref{wildcard}{wildcard}\index{wildcard!in Make} \texttt{\%},
which matches zero or more characters in a filename.
Whatever matches \texttt{\%} in the target also matches in the prerequisites,
so the rule:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{results/%.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/%.txt }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RUN_COUNT}\CharTok{)} \CharTok{$<}\NormalTok{ > }\CharTok{$@}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

will handle \emph{Jane Eyre}, \emph{Moby Dick}, \emph{The Time Machine}, and every other novel in the \texttt{data/} directory.
\texttt{\%} cannot be used in rules' recipes,
which is why \texttt{\$\textless{}} and \texttt{\$@} are needed.

With this rule in place, our entire Makefile is reduced to:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OtherTok{.PHONY:}\DataTypeTok{ all clean}

\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{=}\StringTok{bin/countwords.py}
\DataTypeTok{RUN_COUNT}\CharTok{=}\StringTok{python }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}

\CommentTok{# Regenerate all results.}
\DecValTok{all :}\DataTypeTok{ results/moby_dick.csv results/jane_eyre.csv }\CharTok{\textbackslash{}}
\DataTypeTok{  results/time_machine.csv}

\CommentTok{# Regenerate result for any book.}
\DecValTok{results/%.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/%.txt }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RUN_COUNT}\CharTok{)} \CharTok{$<}\NormalTok{ > }\CharTok{$@}

\CommentTok{# Remove all generated files.}
\DecValTok{clean :}
\NormalTok{    rm -f results/*}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To test our shortened Makefile,
let's delete all of the results files:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ clean}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
rm -f results/*
\end{verbatim}

and then recreate them:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}  \CommentTok{# Same as `make all` as "all" is the first target}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
python bin/countwords.py \
  data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv
python bin/countwords.py \
  data/jane_eyre.txt > results/jane_eyre.csv
python bin/countwords.py \
  data/time_machine.txt > results/time_machine.csv
\end{verbatim}

We can still rebuild individual files if we want,
since Make will take the target filename we give on the command line
and see if a pattern rule matches it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{touch}\NormalTok{ data/jane_eyre.txt}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ results/jane_eyre.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
python bin/countwords.py \
  data/jane_eyre.txt > results/jane_eyre.csv
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{automate-functions}{%
\section{Defining Sets of Files}\label{automate-functions}}

Our analysis is still not fully automated:
if we add another book to \texttt{data},
we have to remember to add its name to the \texttt{all} target in the Makefile as well.
Once again we will fix this in steps.

To start,
imagine that all the results files already exist
and we just want to update them.
We can define a variable called \texttt{RESULTS}
to be a list of all the results files
using the same wildcards we would use in the shell:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{RESULTS}\CharTok{=}\StringTok{results/*.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can then rewrite \texttt{all} to depend on that list:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Regenerate all results.}
\DecValTok{all :}\DataTypeTok{ }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RESULTS}\CharTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However,
this only works if the results files already exist.
If one doesn't,
its name won't be included in \texttt{RESULTS}
and Make won't realize that we want to generate it.

What we really want is to generate the list of results files
based on the list of books in the \texttt{data/} directory.
We can create that list using Make's \texttt{wildcard} function:\index{functions (in Make)}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{DATA}\CharTok{=$(}\KeywordTok{wildcard}\StringTok{ data/*.txt}\CharTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This calls the function \texttt{wildcard} with the argument \texttt{data/*.txt}.
The result is a list of all the text files in the \texttt{data} directory,
just as we would get with \texttt{data/*.txt} in the shell.
The syntax is odd because functions were added to Make long after it was first written,
but at least they have readable names.

To check that this line does the right thing,
we can add another phony target called \texttt{settings}
that uses the shell command \texttt{echo} to print the names and values of our variables:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OtherTok{.PHONY:}\DataTypeTok{ all clean settings}

\CommentTok{# ...everything else...}

\CommentTok{# Show variables' values.}
\DecValTok{settings :}
\NormalTok{    echo COUNT: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
\NormalTok{    echo DATA: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{DATA}\CharTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's run this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ settings}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
echo COUNT: bin/countwords.py
COUNT: bin/countwords.py
echo DATA: data/dracula.txt data/frankenstein.txt
  data/jane_eyre.txt data/moby_dick.txt
  data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
  data/sherlock_holmes.txt data/time_machine.txt
DATA: data/dracula.txt data/frankenstein.txt
  data/jane_eyre.txt data/moby_dick.txt
  data/sense_and_sensibility.txt data/sherlock_holmes.txt
  data/time_machine.txt
\end{verbatim}

The output appears twice
because Make shows us the command it's going to run before running it.
Putting \texttt{@} before the command in the recipe prevents this,
which makes the output easier to read:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{settings :}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo COUNT: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo DATA: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{DATA}\CharTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ settings}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
COUNT: bin/countwords.py
DATA: data/dracula.txt data/frankenstein.txt
  data/jane_eyre.txt data/moby_dick.txt
  data/sense_and_sensibility.txt data/sherlock_holmes.txt
  data/time_machine.txt
\end{verbatim}

We now have the names of our input files.
To create a list of corresponding output files,
we use Make's \texttt{patsubst} function
(short for \textbf{pat}tern \textbf{subst}itution):

\begin{verbatim}
RESULTS=$(patsubst data/%.txt,results/%.csv,$(DATA))
\end{verbatim}

The first argument to \texttt{patsubst} is the pattern to look for,
which in this case is a text file in the \texttt{data} directory.
We use \texttt{\%} to match the \gref{stem}{filename\_stem}\index{filename stem}\index{stem (of filename)} of the file's name,
which is the part we want to keep.

The second argument is the replacement we want.
As in a pattern rule,
Make replaces \texttt{\%} in this argument with whatever matched \texttt{\%} in the pattern,
which creates the name of the result file we want.
Finally,
the third argument is what to do the substitution in,
which is our list of books' names.

Let's check the \texttt{RESULTS} variable by adding another command to the \texttt{settings} target:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{settings :}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\begin{verbatim}
COUNT: bin/countwords.py

  results/jane_eyre.csv results/moby_dick.csv
  results/sense_and_sensibility.csv
  results/sherlock_holmes.csv results/time_machine.csv
\end{verbatim}

Excellent:
\texttt{DATA} has the names of the files we want to process
and \texttt{RESULTS} automatically has the names of the corresponding result files.
Since the phony target \texttt{all} depends on \texttt{\$(RESULTS)}
(i.e., all the files whose names appear in the variable \texttt{RESULTS})
we can regenerate all the results in one step:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ clean}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
rm -f results/*.csv
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}  \CommentTok{# Same as `make all` since "all" is the first target}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
python bin/countwords.py \

python bin/countwords.py \

  data/sherlock_holmes.txt > results/sherlock_holmes.csv
python bin/countwords.py \
  data/time_machine.txt > results/time_machine.csv
\end{verbatim}

Our workflow is now just two steps:
add a data file and run Make.
This is a big improvement over running things manually,
particularly as we start to add more steps like merging data files and generating plots.

\hypertarget{automate-doc}{%
\section{Documenting a Makefile}\label{automate-doc}}

Every well-behaved program should tell people how to use it (Taschuk and Wilson \protect\hyperlink{ref-Tasc2017}{2017}).
If we run \texttt{make\ -\/-help},
we get a (very) long list of options that Make understands,
but nothing about our specific workflow.
We could create another phony target called \texttt{help} that prints a list of available commands:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OtherTok{.PHONY:}\DataTypeTok{ all clean help settings}

\CommentTok{# ...other definitions...}

\CommentTok{# Show help.}
\DecValTok{help :}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo }\StringTok{"all : regenerate all out-of-date results files."}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo }\StringTok{"results/*.csv : regenerate a particular results file."}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo }\StringTok{"clean : remove all generated files."}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo }\StringTok{"settings : show the values of all variables."}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo }\StringTok{"help : show this message."}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

but sooner or later
we will add a target or rule and forget to update this list.

A better approach is to format some comments in a special way
and then extract and display those comments when asked to.
We'll use \texttt{\#\#} (a double comment marker) to indicate the lines we want displayed
and \texttt{grep} (Section~\ref{bash-advanced-find}) to pull these lines out of the file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OtherTok{.PHONY:}\DataTypeTok{ all clean help settings}

\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{=}\StringTok{bin/countwords.py}
\DataTypeTok{DATA}\CharTok{=$(}\KeywordTok{wildcard}\StringTok{ data/*.txt}\CharTok{)}
\DataTypeTok{RESULTS}\CharTok{=$(}\KeywordTok{patsubst}\StringTok{ data/%.txt}\KeywordTok{,}\StringTok{results/%.csv}\KeywordTok{,}\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{DATA}\CharTok{))}

\CommentTok{## all : regenerate all results.}
\DecValTok{all :}\DataTypeTok{ }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RESULTS}\CharTok{)}

\CommentTok{## results/%.csv : regenerate result for any book.}
\DecValTok{results/%.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/%.txt }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
\NormalTok{    python }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)} \CharTok{$<}\NormalTok{ > }\CharTok{$@}

\CommentTok{## clean : remove all generated files.}
\DecValTok{clean :}
\NormalTok{    rm -f results/*.csv}

\CommentTok{## settings : show variables' values.}
\DecValTok{settings :}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo COUNT: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo DATA: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{DATA}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo RESULTS: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RESULTS}\CharTok{)}

\CommentTok{## help : show this message.}
\DecValTok{help :}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{grep }\StringTok{'^##'}\FunctionTok{ ./Makefile}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's test:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ help}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## all : regenerate all results.
## results/%.csv : regenerate result for any book.
## clean : remove all generated files.
## settings : show variables' values.
## help : show this message.
\end{verbatim}

The exercises will explore how to format this more readably.

\hypertarget{automate-pipeline}{%
\section{Automating Entire Analyses}\label{automate-pipeline}}

To finish our discussion of Make,
let's automatically generate a collated list of word frequencies.
The target is a file called \texttt{results/collated.csv}
that depends on the results generated by \texttt{countwords.py}.
To create it,
we add or change these lines in our Makefile:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# ...phony targets and previous variable definitions...}

\DataTypeTok{COLLATE}\CharTok{=}\StringTok{bin/collate.py}

\CommentTok{## all : regenerate all results.}
\DecValTok{all :}\DataTypeTok{ results/collated.csv}

\CommentTok{## results/collated.csv : collate all results.}
\DecValTok{results/collated.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RESULTS}\CharTok{)}\DataTypeTok{ }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COLLATE}\CharTok{)}
\NormalTok{    mkdir -p results  }\CommentTok{# Create dir if it doesn't exist}
\NormalTok{    python }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COLLATE}\CharTok{)} \CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RESULTS}\CharTok{)}\NormalTok{ > }\CharTok{$@}

\CommentTok{## settings : show variables' values.}
\DecValTok{settings :}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo COUNT: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo DATA: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{DATA}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo RESULTS: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RESULTS}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo COLLATE: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COLLATE}\CharTok{)}
\NormalTok{    ...}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The first two lines tell Make about the collation program,
while the change to \texttt{all} tells it what the final target of our pipeline is.
Since this target depends on the results files for single novels,
\texttt{make\ all} will regenerate all of those automatically.

The rule to regenerate \texttt{results/collated.csv} should look familiar by now:
it tells Make that all of the individual results have to be up-to-date
and that the final result should be regenerated if the program used to create it has changed.
One difference between the recipe in this rule and the recipes we've seen before
is that this recipe uses \texttt{\$(RESULTS)} directly instead of an automatic variable.
We have written the rule this way because
there isn't an automatic variable that means \enquote{all but the last prerequisite},
so there's no way to use automatic variables that wouldn't result in us trying to process our program.

Likewise,
we can also add the \texttt{plotcounts.py} script to this workflow
and update the \texttt{all} and \texttt{settings} rules accordingly.
Note that there is no \texttt{\textgreater{}} needed before the \texttt{\$@}
because \texttt{plotcounts.py} default is to write to a file
rather than to {[}standard output{]}{[}stdout{]}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# ...phony targets and previous variable definitions...}

\DataTypeTok{PLOT}\CharTok{=}\StringTok{bin/plotcounts.py}

\CommentTok{## all : regenerate all results.}
\DecValTok{all :}\DataTypeTok{ results/collated.png}

\CommentTok{## results/collated.png: plot the collated results.}
\DecValTok{results/collated.png :}\DataTypeTok{ results/collated.csv}
\NormalTok{    python }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{PLOT}\CharTok{)} \CharTok{$<}\NormalTok{ --outfile }\CharTok{$@}

\CommentTok{## settings : show variables' values.}
\DecValTok{settings :}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo COUNT: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo DATA: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{DATA}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo RESULTS: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RESULTS}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo COLLATE: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COLLATE}\CharTok{)}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{echo PLOT: }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{PLOT}\CharTok{)}
\NormalTok{    ...}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Running \texttt{make\ all} should now generate the new \texttt{collated.png} plot (Figure~\ref{fig:automate-collated}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ all}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
python bin/collate.py results/time_machine.csv \

  results/sense_and_sensibility.csv results/sherlock_holmes.csv \
  results/frankenstein.csv > results/collated.csv
python bin/plotcounts.py results/collated.csv \
  --outfile results/collated.png
alpha: 1.1712445413685917
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/automate/collated} 

}

\caption{Word count distribution for all books combined.}\label{fig:automate-collated}
\end{figure}

Finally,
we can update the \texttt{clean} target
to only remove files created by the Makefile.
It is a good habit to do this rather than using the asterisk wildcard to remove all files,
since you might manually place files in the results directory
and forget that these will be cleaned up when you run \texttt{make\ clean}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# ...phony targets and previous variable definitions...}

\CommentTok{## clean : remove all generated files.}
\DecValTok{clean :}
\NormalTok{    rm }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{RESULTS}\CharTok{)}\NormalTok{ results/collated.csv results/collated.png}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{automate-summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{automate-summary}}

Make's reliance on shell commands instead of direct calls to functions in Python or R
sometimes makes it clumsy to use.
However,
that also makes it very flexible:
a single Makefile can run shell commands and programs written in a variety of languages,
which makes it a great way to assemble pipelines out of whatever is lying around.

Programmers have created many replacements for Make in the 45 years since it was first created---so many,
in fact,
that none have attracted enough users to displace it.
If you would like to explore them,
check out \href{https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/}{Snakemake} (for Python)
and \href{https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/}{drake} (for R).
If you want to go deeper,

\hypertarget{automate-exercises}{%

Our \texttt{Makefile} currently reads as follows:

\end{Shaded}

A number of the exercises below ask you to make further edits to \texttt{Makefile}.

\hypertarget{automate-ex-report-change}{%
\subsection{Report results that would change}\label{automate-ex-report-change}}

How can you get \texttt{make} to show the commands it would run
without actually running them?
(Hint: look at the manual page.)

\hypertarget{automate-ex-useful-options}{%
\subsection{Useful options}\label{automate-ex-useful-options}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What does Make's \texttt{-B} option do and when is it useful?
\item
  What about the \texttt{-C} option?
\item
  What about the \texttt{-f} option?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{automate-ex-mkdir}{%
\subsection{Make sure the output directory exists}\label{automate-ex-mkdir}}

One of our \gref{build recipes}{build\_recipe} includes \texttt{mkdir\ -p}.
What does this do and why is it useful?

\hypertarget{automate-ex-print}{%
\subsection{Print the title and author}\label{automate-ex-print}}

The build rule for regenerating the result for any book is currently:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{## results/%.csv : regenerate result for any book.}
\DecValTok{results/%.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ data/%.txt }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)}
\NormalTok{    python }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COUNT}\CharTok{)} \CharTok{$<}\NormalTok{ > }\CharTok{$@}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Add an extra line to the recipe that uses the \texttt{book\_summary.sh} script
to print the title and author of the book to the screen.
Use \texttt{@bash} so that the command itself isn't printed to the screen
and don't forget to update the settings build rule to include the \texttt{book\_summary.sh} script.

If you've successfully made those changes,
you should get the following output for \emph{Dracula}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ -B results/dracula.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Title: Dracula
Author: Bram Stoker
python bin/countwords.py data/dracula.txt > results/dracula.csv
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{automate-ex-all-results}{%
\subsection{Create all results}\label{automate-ex-all-results}}

The default target of our final \texttt{Makefile} re-creates \texttt{results/collated.csv}.
Add a target to \texttt{Makefile}
so that \texttt{make\ results} creates or updates any result files that are missing or out of date,
but does \emph{not} regenerate \texttt{results/collated.csv}.

\hypertarget{automate-ex-wildcard-perils}{%
\subsection{The perils of shell wildcards}\label{automate-ex-wildcard-perils}}

What is wrong with writing the rule for \texttt{results/collated.csv} like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{results/collated.csv :}\DataTypeTok{ results/*.csv}
\NormalTok{    python }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{COLLATE}\CharTok{)} \CharTok{$^}\NormalTok{ > }\CharTok{$@}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

(The fact that the result no longer depends on the program used to create it
isn't the biggest problem.)

\hypertarget{automate-ex-readable-docs}{%
\subsection{Making documentation more readable}\label{automate-ex-readable-docs}}

We can format the documentation in our Makefile more readably using this command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{## help : show all commands.}
\DecValTok{help :}
    \CharTok{@}\FunctionTok{grep -h -E }\StringTok{'^##'}\FunctionTok{ }\CharTok{$\{}\DataTypeTok{MAKEFILE_LIST}\CharTok{\}}\FunctionTok{ | sed -e }\StringTok{'s/## //g'}\FunctionTok{ }\CharTok{\textbackslash{}}
\FunctionTok{    | column -t -s }\StringTok{':'}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Using \texttt{man} and online search,
explain what every part of this recipe does.

\hypertarget{automate-ex-configuration}{%
\section{Configuration}\label{automate-ex-configuration}}

Let's say that in future we intend to write a number of different Makefiles
that all use the \texttt{countwords.py}, \texttt{collate.py} and \texttt{plotcounts.py} scripts.

To avoid duplication,
cut and paste the definitions of the \texttt{COUNT}, \texttt{COLLATE} and \texttt{PLOT} variables
into a separate file called \texttt{config.mk}.
Use the \texttt{include} command to access those definitions in the existing \texttt{Makefile}.

(In Chapter~\ref{config} we discuss configuration strategies in more detail.)

\hypertarget{automate-keypoints}{%
\section{Key Points}\label{automate-keypoints}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/make/}{Make} is a widely-used build manager.
\item
  A \gref{build manager}{build\_manager} re-runs commands to update files that are out of date.
\item
  A \gref{build rule}{build\_rule} has \gref{targets}{build\_target}, \gref{prerequisites}{prerequisite}, and a \gref{recipe}{build\_recipe}.
\item
  A target can be a file or a \gref{phony target}{phony\_target} that simply triggers an action.
\item
  When a target is out of date with respect to its prerequisites, Make executes the recipe associated with its rule.
\item
  Make executes as many rules as it needs to when updating files, but always respects prerequisite order.
\item
  Make defines \gref{automatic variables}{automatic\_variable} such as \texttt{\$@} (target), \texttt{\$\^{}} (all prerequisites), and \texttt{\$\textless{}} (first prerequisite).
\item
  \gref{Pattern rules}{pattern\_rule} can use \texttt{\%} as a placeholder for parts of filenames.
\item
  Makefiles can define variables using \texttt{NAME=value}.
\item

\item

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{config}{%
\chapter{Configuring Programs}\label{config}}

\begin{quote}
Always be wary of any helpful item that weighs less than its operating manual.

--- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}
\end{quote}

In previous chapters we used command-line options to control our scripts and programs.
If they are more complex,\index{shell script!configuring}\index{Python!configuring program}
we may want to use up to four layers of configuration:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A system-wide configuration file for general settings.
\item
  A user-specific configuration file for personal preferences.
\item
  A job-specific file with settings for a particular run.
\item
  Command-line options to change things that commonly change.
\end{enumerate}

This is sometimes called \gref{overlay configuration}{overlay\_configuration}\index{overlay configuration}\index{configuration!overlay}
because each level overrides the ones above it:
the user's configuration file overrides the system settings,
the job configuration overrides the user's defaults,
and the command-line options overrides that.
This is more complex than most research software needs initially (Xu et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Xu2015}{2015}),
but being able to read a complete set of options from a file
is a big boost to reproducibility.

In this chapter,
we'll explore a number approaches for configuring our Zipf's Law project,
and ultimately decide to apply one of them.
That project should now contain:

\begin{verbatim}
zipf/
├── .gitignore
├── CONDUCT.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md

\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Be Careful When Applying Settings Outside Your Project}

This chapter's examples modify files outside of the Zipf's Law project
in order to illustrate some concepts.
If you alter these files while following along,
remember to change them back later.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{config-formats}{%
\section{Configuration File Formats}\label{config-formats}}

Programmers have invented far too many formats for configuration files;
rather than creating one of your own,
you should adopt some widely-used approach.
One is to write the configuration as a Python module
and load it as if it was a library.
This is clever,
but means that tools in other languages can't process it.

A second option is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file}{Windows INI format},\index{Windows INI format}
which is laid out like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{[section1]}
\DataTypeTok{key1}\OtherTok{=}\StringTok{value1}
\DataTypeTok{key2}\OtherTok{=}\StringTok{value2}

\KeywordTok{[section2]}
\DataTypeTok{key3}\OtherTok{=}\StringTok{value3}
\DataTypeTok{key4}\OtherTok{=}\StringTok{value4}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

INI files are simple to read and write,
but the format is slowly falling out of use in favor of \gref{YAML}{yaml}.\index{YAML!configuration files}
A simple YAML configuration file looks like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Standard settings for thesis.}
\FunctionTok{logfile}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\StringTok{"/tmp/log.txt"}
\FunctionTok{quiet}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\CharTok{false}
\FunctionTok{overwrite}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\CharTok{false}
\FunctionTok{fonts}\KeywordTok{:}
\KeywordTok{-}\AttributeTok{ Verdana}
\KeywordTok{-}\AttributeTok{ Serif}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here,
the keys \texttt{logfile}, \texttt{quiet}, and \texttt{overwrite}
have the values \texttt{/tmp/log.txt}, \texttt{false}, and \texttt{false} respectively,
while the value associated with the key \texttt{fonts}
is a list containing \texttt{Verdana} and \texttt{Serif}.
For more discussion of YAML, see Appendix~\ref{yaml}.

\hypertarget{config-matplotlib}{%
\section{Matplotlib Configuration}\label{config-matplotlib}}

To see overlay configuration in action,
let's consider a common task in data science:
changing the size of the labels on a plot.
The labels on our \emph{Jane Eyre} word frequency plot are fine for viewing on screen
(Figure~\ref{fig:configuration-jane-eyre-default}),
but they will need to be bigger
if we want to include the figure in a slideshow or report.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/config/jane-eyre-default} 

}

\caption{Word frequency distribution for Jane Eyre with default label sizes.}\label{fig:configuration-jane-eyre-default}
\end{figure}

We could use any of the overlay options described above
to change the size of the labels:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Edit the system-wide Matplotlib configuration file\index{Matplotlib!configuration}
  (which would affect everyone using this computer).
\item
  Create a user-specific Matplotlib style sheet.
\item
  Create a job-specific configuration file to set plotting options in \texttt{plotcounts.py}.
\item
  Add some new command-line options to \texttt{plotcounts.py} .
\end{itemize}

Let's consider these options one by one.

\hypertarget{config-global}{%
\section{The Global Configuration File}\label{config-global}}

Our first configuration possibility
is to edit the system-wide Matplotlib runtime configuration file,\index{configuration!global}
which is called \texttt{matplotlibrc}.
When we import Matplotlib,
it uses this file to set the default characteristics of the plot.
We can find it on our system by running this command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ matplotlib }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ mpl}
\NormalTok{mpl.matplotlib_fname()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
/Users/amira/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/matplotlib/
mpl-data/matplotlibrc
\end{verbatim}

In this case the file is located in the Python installation directory (\texttt{anaconda3}).
All the different Python packages installed with Anaconda
live in a \texttt{python3.7/site-packages} directory,
including Matplotlib.

\texttt{matplotlibrc} lists all the default settings as comments.
The default size of the X and Y axis labels is \enquote{medium},
as is the size of the tick labels:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{#axes.labelsize    : medium  ## fontsize of the x any y labels}
\CommentTok{#xtick.labelsize   : medium  ## fontsize of the tick labels}
\CommentTok{#ytick.labelsize   : medium  ## fontsize of the tick labels}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can uncomment those lines and change the sizes to \enquote{large} and \enquote{extra large}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{axes.labelsize     }\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ x-large}\CommentTok{  ## fontsize of the x any y labels}
\FunctionTok{xtick.labelsize    }\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ large}\CommentTok{    ## fontsize of the tick labels}
\FunctionTok{ytick.labelsize    }\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ large}\CommentTok{    ## fontsize of the tick labels}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and then re-generate the \emph{Jane Eyre} plot with bigger labels
(Figure~\ref{fig:configuration-jane-eyre-big-labels}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ python }\BuiltInTok{bin}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{plotcounts.py results}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{jane_eyre.csv }\OperatorTok{--}\NormalTok{outfile}
\NormalTok{  results}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{jane_eyre.png}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/config/jane-eyre-big-labels} 

}

\caption{Word frequency distribution for Jane Eyre with larger labels.}\label{fig:configuration-jane-eyre-big-labels}
\end{figure}

This does what we want,
but is usually the wrong approach.
Since the \texttt{matplotlibrc} file sets system-wide defaults,
we will now have big labels by default for all plotting we do in future,
which we may not want.
Secondly,
we want to package our Zipf's Law code and make it available to other people (Chapter~\ref{packaging}).
That package won't include our \texttt{matplotlibrc} file,
and we don't have access to the one on their computer,
so this solution isn't as reproducible as others.

A global options file \emph{is} useful, though.
If we are using Matplotlib with \gref{LaTeX}{latex} to generate reports
and the latter is installed in an unusual place on our computing cluster,
a one-line change in \texttt{matplotlibrc} can prevent a lot of failed jobs.

\hypertarget{config-user}{%
\section{The User Configuration File}\label{config-user}}

If we don't want to change the configuration for everyone,
we can change it for just ourself.
Matplotlib defines several carefully-designed styles for plots:\index{configuration!user}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ matplotlib.pyplot }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ plt}
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(plt.style.available)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
['seaborn-dark', 'seaborn-darkgrid', 'seaborn-ticks',
'fivethirtyeight', 'seaborn-whitegrid', 'classic',
'_classic_test', 'fast', 'seaborn-talk', 'seaborn-dark-palette',
'seaborn-bright', 'seaborn-pastel', 'grayscale',
'seaborn-notebook', 'ggplot', 'seaborn-colorblind',
'seaborn-muted', 'seaborn', 'Solarize_Light2', 'seaborn-paper',
'bmh', 'tableau-colorblind10', 'seaborn-white',
'dark_background', 'seaborn-poster', 'seaborn-deep']
\end{verbatim}

In order to make the labels bigger in all of our Zipf's Law plots,
we could create a custom Matplotlib style sheet.
The convention is to store custom style sheets in a \texttt{stylelib} sub-directory
in the Matplotlib configuration directory.
That directory can be located by running the following command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mpl.get_configdir()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
/Users/amira/.matplotlib
\end{verbatim}

Once we've created the new sub-directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mkdir}\NormalTok{ /Users/amira/.matplotlib/stylelib}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

we can add a new file called \texttt{big-labels.mplstyle}
that has the same YAML format as the \texttt{matplotlibrc} file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{axes.labelsize   : x}\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{large  }\CommentTok{## fontsize of the x any y labels}
\NormalTok{xtick.labelsize  : large    }\CommentTok{## fontsize of the tick labels}
\NormalTok{ytick.labelsize  : large    }\CommentTok{## fontsize of the tick labels}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To use this new style,
we would just need to add one line to \texttt{plotcounts.py}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{plt.style.use(}\StringTok{'big-labels'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Using a custom style sheet leaves the system-wide defaults unchanged,
and it's a good way to achieve a consistent look across our personal data visualization projects.
However,
since each user has their own \texttt{stylelib} directory,
it doesn't solve the problem of ensuring that other people can reproduce our plots.

\hypertarget{config-command-line}{%
\section{Adding Command-Line Options}\label{config-command-line}}

A third way to change the plot's properties\index{configuration!command-line option}
is to add some new command-line arguments to \texttt{plotcounts.py}.
The \texttt{choices} parameter of \texttt{add\_argument} lets us tell \texttt{argparse}
that the user is only allowed to specify a value from a predefined list:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mpl_sizes }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [}\StringTok{'xx-small'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'x-small'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'small'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'medium'}\NormalTok{,}
             \StringTok{'large'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'x-large'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'xx-large'}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'--labelsize'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{str}\NormalTok{, default}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'x-large'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{                    choices}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{mpl_sizes,}
                    \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'fontsize of the x any y labels'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'--xticksize'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{str}\NormalTok{, default}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'large'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{                    choices}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{mpl_sizes,}
                    \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'fontsize of the x tick labels'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'--yticksize'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{str}\NormalTok{, default}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'large'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{                    choices}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{mpl_sizes,}
                    \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'fontsize of the y tick labels'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can then add a few lines after the \texttt{ax} variable is defined in \texttt{plotcounts.py}
to update the label sizes according to the user input:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ax.xaxis.label.set_fontsize(args.labelsize)}
\NormalTok{ax.yaxis.label.set_fontsize(args.labelsize)}
\NormalTok{ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(labelsize}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{args.xticksize)}
\NormalTok{ax.yaxis.set_tick_params(labelsize}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{args.yticksize)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Alternatively,
we can change the default runtime configuration settings before the plot is created.
These are stored in a variable called \texttt{matplotlib.rcParams}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mpl.rcParams[}\StringTok{'axes.labelsize'}\NormalTok{] }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ args.labelsize}
\NormalTok{mpl.rcParams[}\StringTok{'xtick.labelsize'}\NormalTok{] }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ args.xticksize}
\NormalTok{mpl.rcParams[}\StringTok{'ytick.labelsize'}\NormalTok{] }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ args.yticksize}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Adding extra command line arguments is a good solution
if we only want to change a small number of plot characteristics.
It also makes our work more reproducible:
if we use a Makefile to regenerate our plots (Chapter~\ref{automate}),
the settings will all be saved in one place.
However,
\texttt{matplotlibrc} has hundreds of parameters we could change,
so the number of new arguments can quickly get out of hand
if we want to tweak other aspects of the plot.

\hypertarget{config-job-file}{%
\section{A Job Control File}\label{config-job-file}}

The final option for configuring our plots---the one we will actually adopt in this case--- is
to pass a YAML file full of Matplotlib parameters to \texttt{plotcounts.py}.\index{configuration!file}
First,
we save the parameters we want to change in a file inside our project directory.
We can call it anything,
but \texttt{plotparams.yml} seems like it will be easy to remember:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{axes.labelsize   }\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ x-large}\CommentTok{  ## fontsize of the x any y labels}
\FunctionTok{xtick.labelsize  }\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ large}\CommentTok{    ## fontsize of the tick labels}
\FunctionTok{ytick.labelsize  }\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ large}\CommentTok{    ## fontsize of the tick labels}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Because this file is located in our project directory
instead of the user-specific style sheet directory,
we need to add one new option to \texttt{plotcounts.py} to load it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'--plotparams'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{str}\NormalTok{, default}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{None}\NormalTok{,}
                    \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'matplotlib parameters (YAML file)'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can use Python's \texttt{yaml} library to read that file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{with} \BuiltInTok{open}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'plotparams.yml'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'r'}\NormalTok{) }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ reader:}
\NormalTok{    plot_params }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ yaml.load(reader, Loader}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{yaml.BaseLoader)}
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(plot_params)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
{'axes.labelsize': 'x-large',
 'xtick.labelsize': 'large',
 'ytick.labelsize': 'large'}
\end{verbatim}

and then loop over each item in \texttt{plot\_params} to update Matplotlib's \texttt{mpl.rcParams}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ (param, value) }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ param_dict.items():}
\NormalTok{    mpl.rcParams[param] }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ value}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\texttt{plotcounts.py} now looks like this:

\begin{Shaded}

\hypertarget{config-summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{config-summary}}

Programs are only useful if they can be controlled,
and work is only reproducible if those controls are explicit and shareable.
If the number of controls needed is small,
adding command-line options to programs and setting those options in Makefiles
is usually the best solution.
As the number of options grows,
so too does the value of putting options in files of their own.
And if we are installing the software on large systems that are used by many people,
such as a research cluster,
system-wide configuration files let us hide the details
from people who just want to get their science done.

More generally,
the problem of configuring a program illustrates the difference
between \enquote{works for me on my machine}
and \enquote{works for everyone, everywhere}.
From reproducible workflows (Chapter~\ref{automate}) to logging (Section~\ref{errors-logging}),
this difference influences every aspect of a research software engineer's work.
We don't always have to design for large-scale re-use,
but knowing what it entails allows us to make a conscious, thoughtful choice.

\hypertarget{config-exercises}{%
\section{Exercises}\label{config-exercises}}

\hypertarget{config-ex-build-plotparams}{%
\subsection{Building with plotting parameters}\label{config-ex-build-plotparams}}

In the \texttt{Makefile} created in Chapter~\ref{automate},
the build rule involving \texttt{plotcounts.py} was defined as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{## results/collated.png: plot the collated results.}
\DecValTok{results/collated.png :}\DataTypeTok{ results/collated.csv}
\NormalTok{    python }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{PLOT}\CharTok{)} \CharTok{$<}\NormalTok{ --outfile }\CharTok{$@}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Update that build rule to include the new \texttt{-\/-plotparams} option.
Make sure \texttt{plotparams.yml} is added as a second prerequisite in the updated build rule
so that the appropriate commands will be re-run if the plotting parameters change.

Hint: We use the automatic variable \texttt{\$\textless{}} to access the first prerequisite,
but you'll need \texttt{\$(word\ 2,\$\^{})} to access the second.
Read about automatic variables (Section~\ref{automate-autovar}) and
\href{https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html\#Text-Functions}{functions for string substitution and analysis}
to understand what that command is doing.

\hypertarget{config-ex-style}{%
\subsection{Using different plot styles}\label{config-ex-style}}

There are a wide variety of pre-defined matplotlib styles (Section~\ref{config-user}),
as illustrated at the \href{https://python-graph-gallery.com/199-matplotlib-style-sheets/}{Python Graph Gallery}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Add a new option \texttt{-\/-style} to \texttt{plotcounts.py} that allows the user
  to pick a style from the list of pre-defined matplotlib styles.
\end{enumerate}

Hint: Use the \texttt{choices} parameter discussed in Section~\ref{config-command-line}
to define the valid choices for the new \texttt{-\/-style} option.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Re-generate the plot of the \emph{Jane Eyre} word count distribution
  using a bunch of different styles to decide which you like best.
\item
  Matplotlib style sheets are designed to be composed together.
  (See the \href{https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html}{style sheets tutorial} for details.)
  Use the \texttt{nargs} parameter to allow the user to pass any number of styles
  when using the \texttt{-\/-style} option.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{config-ex-saveload}{%
\subsection{Saving configurations}\label{config-ex-saveload}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Add an option \texttt{-\/-saveconfig\ filename} to \texttt{plotcounts.py}
  that writes all of its configuration to a file.
  Make sure this option saves \emph{all} of the configuration,
  including any defaults that the user hasn't changed.
\item
  Add a new target \texttt{test-saveconfig} to the \texttt{Makefile}
  created in Chapter~\ref{automate} to test that the new option
  is working.
\item
  How would this new \texttt{-\/-saveconfig} option make your work more reproducible?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{config-ex-ini}{%
\subsection{Using INI syntax}\label{config-ex-ini}}

If we used \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file}{Windows INI format} instead of YAML
for our plot parameters configuration file
(i.e.~\texttt{plotparams.ini} instead of \texttt{plotparams.yml})
that file would read as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{[AXES]}
\DataTypeTok{axes.labelsize}\OtherTok{=}\StringTok{x-large}

\KeywordTok{[TICKS]}
\DataTypeTok{xtick.labelsize}\OtherTok{=}\StringTok{large}
\DataTypeTok{ytick.labelsize}\OtherTok{=}\StringTok{large}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html}{\texttt{configparser}} library can be used to read and write INI files.
Install that library by running \texttt{pip\ install\ configparser} at the command line.

Using \texttt{configparser}, rewrite the \texttt{set\_plot\_params} function in \texttt{plotcounts.py} to
handle a configuration file in INI rather than YAML format.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Which file format do you find easier to work with?
\item
  What other factors should influence your choice of a configuration file syntax?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{config-ex-consistency}{%
\subsection{Configuration consistency}\label{config-ex-consistency}}

In order for a data processing pipeline to work correctly,
some of the configuration parameters for Program~A and Program~B must be the same.
However,
the programs were written by different teams,
and each has its own configuration file.
What steps could you take to ensure the required consistency?

\hypertarget{config-keypoints}{%

We have written software to count and analyze the words in classic texts,
but how can we be sure it's producing reliable results?
The short is answer is that we can't---not completely---but
we can test its behavior against our expectations to decide if we are sure enough.
This chapter explores ways to do this,
including assertions, unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests.

\textbf{A Scientist's Nightmare}

Why is testing research software important?
A successful early career researcher in protein crystallography,
Geoffrey Chang,
had to retract five published papers---three from
the journal \emph{Science}---because his code had
inadvertently flipped two columns of data (Miller \protect\hyperlink{ref-Mill2006}{2006}).
More recently, a simple calculation mistake in a paper by Reinhart and Rogoff
contributed to making the financial crash of 2008 even worse
for millions of people (Borwein and Bailey \protect\hyperlink{ref-Borw2013}{2013}).
Testing helps to catch errors like these.

\hypertarget{testing-assertions}{%
\section{Assertions}\label{testing-assertions}}

The first step in building confidence in our programs
is to assume that mistakes will happen and guard against them.
This is called \gref{defensive programming}{defensive\_programming},\index{defensive programming}
and the most common way to do it is to add \gref{assertions}{assertion} to our code\index{assertion}\index{Python!assertion}
so that it checks itself as it runs.
An assertion is a statement that something must be true at a certain point in a program.
When Python sees an assertion, it checks the assertion's condition.
If it's true, Python does nothing;
if it's false,
Python halts the program immediately and prints a user-defined error message.
For example,
this code halts as soon as the loop encounters an impossible word frequency:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{frequencies }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [}\DecValTok{13}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{-4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{25}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{total }\OperatorTok{=} \FloatTok{0.0}
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ freq }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ frequencies[:}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{]:}
    \ControlFlowTok{assert}\NormalTok{ freq }\OperatorTok{>=} \FloatTok{0.0}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'Word frequencies must be non-negative'}
\NormalTok{    total }\OperatorTok{+=}\NormalTok{ freq}
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'total frequency of first 5 words:'}\NormalTok{, total)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                  Traceback (most recent call last)

      3 for freq in frequencies[:5]:
----> 4     assert freq >= 0.0, 'Word frequencies must be non-negative'
      5     total += freq
      6 print('total frequency of first 5 words:', total)

AssertionError: Word frequencies must be non-negative
\end{verbatim}

Programs intended for widespread use are full of assertions:
10-20\% of the code they contain are there to check that the other 80-90\% are working correctly.
Broadly speaking, assertions fall into three categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A \gref{precondition}{precondition}\index{precondition (in program)}\index{assertion!precondition}
  is something that must be true at the start of a function
  in order for it to work correctly.
  For example,
  a function might check that the list it has been given has at least two elements
  and that all of its elements are integers.
\item
  A \gref{postcondition}{postcondition}\index{postcondition (in program)}\index{assertion!postcondition}
  is something that the function guarantees is true
  when it finishes.
  For example,
  a function could check that the value being returned is an integer
  that is greater than zero,
  but less than the length of the input list.
\item
  An \gref{invariant}{invariant}\index{invariant (in program)}\index{assertion!invariant}
  is something that is true for every iteration in a loop.
  The invariant might be a property of the data (as in the example above),
  or it might be something like,
  \enquote{the value of \texttt{highest} is less than or equal to the current loop index}.
\end{itemize}

The function \texttt{get\_power\_law\_params} in our \texttt{plotcounts.py} script
is a good example of the need for a precondition.
Its docstring does not say that its \texttt{word\_counts} parameter must be a list of numeric word counts;
even if we add that,
a user might easily pass in a list of the words themselves instead.
Adding an assertion makes the requirement clearer,
and also guarantees that the function will fail as soon as it is called
rather than returning an error from \texttt{scipy.optimize.minimize\_scalar}
that would be more difficult to interpret/debug.

\hypertarget{testing-unit}{%
\section{Unit Testing}\label{testing-unit}}

Catching errors is good, but preventing them is better,
so responsible programmers test their code.
As the name suggests,
a \gref{unit test}{unit\_test}\index{unit test}\index{testing!unit test}
checks the correctness of a single unit of software.
Exactly what constitutes a \enquote{unit} is subjective,
but it typically means the behavior of a single function in one situation.
In our Zipf's Law software,
the \texttt{count\_words} function in \texttt{wordcounts.py} is
a good candidate for unit testing:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ count_words(reader):}
    \CommentTok{"""Count the occurrence of each word in a string."""}
\NormalTok{    text }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ reader.read()}
\NormalTok{    chunks }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ text.split()}
\NormalTok{    stripped }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [word.strip(string.punctuation) }\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ word }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ chunks]}
\NormalTok{    word_list }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [word.lower() }\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ word }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ stripped }\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ word]}
\NormalTok{    word_counts }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ Counter(word_list)}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ word_counts}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

A single unit test will typically have:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a \gref{fixture}{fixture},\index{testing!fixture}\index{fixture (of test)}
  which is the thing being tested (e.g., an array of numbers);
\item
  an \gref{actual result}{actual\_result},\index{testing!actual result}\index{actual result (of test)}
  which is what the code produces when given the fixture;
  and
\item
  an \gref{expected result}{expected\_result}\index{testing!expected result}\index{expected result (of test)}
  that the actual result is compared to.
\end{itemize}

The fixture is typically a subset or smaller version of the data
the function will typically process.
For instance,
in order to write a unit test for the \texttt{count\_words} function,
we could use a piece of text small enough for us to count word frequencies by hand.
Let's add the poem \emph{Risk} by Anaïs Nin to our data:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ~/zipf}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mkdir}\NormalTok{ test_data}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cat}\NormalTok{ test_data/risk.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
And then the day came,
when the risk
to remain tight
in a bud
was more painful
than the risk
it took
to blossom.
\end{verbatim}

We can then count the words by hand to construct the expected result:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{from}\NormalTok{ collections }\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ Counter}


\NormalTok{risk_poem_counts }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ \{}\StringTok{'the'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'risk'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'to'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'and'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}
  \StringTok{'then'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'day'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'came'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'when'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'remain'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}
  \StringTok{'tight'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'in'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'a'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'bud'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'was'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'more'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}
  \StringTok{'painful'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'than'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'it'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'took'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'blossom'}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{\}}
\NormalTok{expected_result }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ Counter(risk_poem_counts)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We then generate the actual result by calling \texttt{word\_counts},
and use an assertion to check if it is what we expected:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ countwords}


\ControlFlowTok{with} \BuiltInTok{open}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'test_data/risk.txt'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'r'}\NormalTok{) }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ reader:}
\NormalTok{    actual_result }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ countwords.count_words(reader)}
\ControlFlowTok{assert}\NormalTok{ actual_result }\OperatorTok{==}\NormalTok{ expected_result}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There's no output,
which means the assertion (and test) passed.
(Remember, assertions only do something if the condition is false.)

\hypertarget{testing-framework}{%
\section{Testing Frameworks}\label{testing-framework}}

Writing one unit test is easy enough,
but we should check other cases as well.
To manage them,
we can use a \gref{test framework}{test\_framework}\index{test framework}\index{testing!framework}
(also called a \gref{test runner}{test\_runner}).
The most widely-used test framework for Python is called \href{https://pytest.org/}{\texttt{pytest}},
which structures tests as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Tests are put in files whose names begin with \texttt{test\_}.
\item
  Each test is a function whose name also begins with \texttt{test\_}.
\item
  These functions use \texttt{assert} to check results.
\end{enumerate}

Following these rules,
we can create a \texttt{test\_zipfs.py} script that contains the test we just developed:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

    \ControlFlowTok{assert}\NormalTok{ actual_result }\OperatorTok{==}\NormalTok{ expected_result}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{pytest} library comes with a command-line tool that is also called \texttt{pytest}.
When we run it with no options,
it searches for all files in or below the working directory
whose names match the pattern \texttt{test\_*.py}.
It then runs the tests in these files and summarizes their results.
(If we only want to run the tests in a particular file,
we can use the command \texttt{pytest\ path/to/test\_file.py}.)

\begin{Shaded}

To add more tests,
we simply write more \texttt{test\_} functions in \texttt{test\_zipfs.py}.
For instance,
besides counting words,
the other critical part of our code is the calculation of the \(\alpha\) parameter.
Earlier we defined a power law relating \(\alpha\)
to the word frequency \(f\),
the word rank \(r\),
and a constant of proportionality \(c\) (Section~\ref{git-advanced-theory}):\[
r = cf^{\frac{-1}{\alpha}}
\]
We also noted that Zipf's Law holds exactly when \(\alpha\) is equal to one.
Setting \(\alpha\) to one and re-arranging the power law gives us:\[
c = f/r
\]

We can use this formula to generate synthetic word counts data
(i.e.~our test fixture)
with a constant of proportionality set to a hypothetical maximum word frequency of 600
(and thus \(r\) ranges from 1 to 600):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ numpy }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ np}


\NormalTok{max_freq }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{600}
\NormalTok{word_counts }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np.floor(max_freq }\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{ np.arange(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, max_freq }\OperatorTok{+} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{))}
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(word_counts)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[600. 300. 200. 150. 120. 100.  85.  75.  66.  60.  54.  50.
  46.  42.  40.  37.  35.  33.  31.  30.  28.  27.  26.  25.
 ...
   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.]
\end{verbatim}

(We use \texttt{np.floor} to round down to the nearest whole number,
because we can't have fractional word counts.)
Passing this test fixture to \texttt{get\_power\_law\_params} in \texttt{plotcounts.py}
should give us a value of 1.0.
To test this, we can add a second test to \texttt{test\_zipfs.py}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

The output tells us that one test failed but the other test passed.
This is a very useful feature of test runners like \texttt{pytest}:
they continue on and complete all the tests
rather than stopping at the first assertion failure as a regular Python script would.

\hypertarget{testing-numeric}{%
\section{Testing Floating-Point Values}\label{testing-numeric}}

The output above shows that that while \texttt{test\_alpha} failed,
the \texttt{actual\_alpha} value of 0.9951524579316625 was very close to the expected value of 1.0.
After a bit of thought,
we decide that this isn't actually a failure:
the value produced by \texttt{get\_power\_law\_params} is an estimate,
and being off by half a percent is good enough.\index{testing!floating-point calculations}

This example shows that testing scientific software
almost always requires us to make the same kind of judgment calls
that scientists have to make when doing any other sort of experimental work.
If we are measuring the mass of a proton,
we might expect ten decimal places of accuracy.
If we are measuring the weight of a baby penguin,
on the other hand,
we'll probably be satisfied if we're within five grams.
What matters most is that we are explicit about the bounds we used
so that other people can tell what we actually did.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Degrees of Difficulty}

There's an old joke that physicists worry about decimal places,
astronomers worry about powers of ten,
and economists are happy if they've got the sign right.
\end{quote}

So how should we write tests when we don't know precisely what the right answer is?
The best approach is to write tests that check
if the actual value is within some \gref{tolerance}{tolerance} of the expected value.\index{testing!tolerance}\index{tolerance (of test)}
The tolerance can be expressed as the \gref{absolute error}{absolute\_error},\index{absolute error}\index{error!absolute}
which is the absolute value of the difference between two,
or the \gref{relative error}{relative\_error},\index{relative error}\index{error!relative}
which the ratio of the absolute error to the value we're approximating (Goldberg \protect\hyperlink{ref-Gold1991}{1991}).
For example,
if we add 9+1 and get 11,
the absolute error is 1 (i.e., 11-10),
and the relative error is 10\%.
If we add 99+1 and get 101,
on the other hand,
the absolute error is still 1,
but the relative error is only 1\%.

For \texttt{test\_alpha},
we might decide that an absolute error of 0.01 in the estimation of \(\alpha\) is acceptable.
If we are using \texttt{pytest},
we can check that values lie within this tolerance using \texttt{pytest.approx}:

\textbf{Testing Visualizations}

Testing visualizations is hard:
any change to the dimension of the plot,
however small,
can change many pixels in a \gref{raster image}{raster\_image},
and cosmetic changes such as moving the legend up a couple of pixels
will cause all of our tests to fail.

The simplest solution is therefore to test the data used to produce the image
rather than the image itself.
Unless we suspect that the plotting library contains bugs,
the correct data should always produce the correct plot.

\hypertarget{testing-integration}{%
\section{Integration Testing}\label{testing-integration}}

Our Zipf's Law analysis has two steps:
counting the words in a text
and estimating the \(\alpha\) parameter from the word count.
Our unit tests give us some confidence that these components work in isolation,
but do they work correctly together?
Checking that is called \gref{integration testing}{integration\_test}.\index{testing!integration test}\index{integration test}

Integration tests are structured the same way as unit tests:
a fixture is used to produce an actual result
that is compared against the expected result.
However,
creating the fixture and running the code
can be considerably more complicated.
For example,
in the case of our Zipf's Law software an appropriate integration test fixture
might be a text file with a word frequency distribution that has a known \(\alpha\) value.
In order to create this text fixture,
we need a way to generate random words.

Fortunately, a Python library called \texttt{randomwordgenerator} exists to do just that.
We can install it and the \texttt{pypandoc} library it depends on
using \href{https://pypi.org/project/pip/}{\texttt{pip}}, the Python Package Installer:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{pip}\NormalTok{ install pypandoc}
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{pip}\NormalTok{ install randomwordgenerator}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Borrowing from the word count distribution we created for \texttt{test\_alpha},
we can then create a text file full of random words
with a frequency distribution that corresponds to an \(\alpha\) of approximately 1.0:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ numpy }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ np}
\ImportTok{from}\NormalTok{ randomwordgenerator }\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ randomwordgenerator }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ rwg}


\NormalTok{max_freq }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{600}
\NormalTok{word_counts }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np.floor(max_freq }\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{ np.arange(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, max_freq }\OperatorTok{+} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{random_words }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ rwg.generate_random_words(n}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{max_freq)}
\NormalTok{writer }\OperatorTok{=} \BuiltInTok{open}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'test_data/random_words.txt'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'w'}\NormalTok{)}
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ index }\KeywordTok{in} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(max_freq):}
\NormalTok{    count }\OperatorTok{=} \BuiltInTok{int}\NormalTok{(word_counts[index])}
\NormalTok{    word_sequence }\OperatorTok{=} \SpecialStringTok{f"}\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{random_words[index]}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{ "} \OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{ count}
\NormalTok{    writer.write(word_sequence }\OperatorTok{+} \StringTok{'}\CharTok{\textbackslash{}n}\StringTok{'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{writer.close()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can then add this integration test to \texttt{test\_zipfs.py}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ test_integration():}
    \CommentTok{"""Test the full word count to alpha parameter workflow."""}

\NormalTok{    counts_array }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np.array(}\BuiltInTok{list}\NormalTok{(word_counts_dict.values()))}
\NormalTok{    actual_alpha }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ plotcounts.get_power_law_params(counts_array)}
\NormalTok{    expected_alpha }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ pytest.approx(}\FloatTok{1.0}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{abs}\OperatorTok{=}\FloatTok{0.01}\NormalTok{)}
    \ControlFlowTok{assert}\NormalTok{ actual_alpha }\OperatorTok{==}\NormalTok{ expected_alpha}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Finally,
we re-run \texttt{pytest} to check that the integration test passes:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{pytest}

\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{testing-regression}{%
\section{Regression Testing}\label{testing-regression}}

So far we have tested two simplified texts:
a short poem and a collection of random words with a known frequency distribution.
The next step is to test with real data,
i.e., an actual book.
The problem is,
we don't know the expected result:
it's not practical to count the words in \emph{Dracula} by hand,
and even if we tried,
the odds are good that we'd make a mistake.

For this kind of situation we can use
\gref{regression testing}{regression\_testing}.\index{testing!regression test}\index{regression test}
Rather than assuming that the test author knows what the expected result should be,
regression tests compares today's answer with a previous one.
This doesn't guarantee that the answer is right---if the original answer is wrong,
we could carry that mistake forward indefinitely---but
it does draw attention to any changes (or \enquote{regressions}).

In Section~\ref{git-advanced-zipf-verify}
we calculated an \(\alpha\) of 1.0866646252515038 for \emph{Dracula}.
Let's use that value to add a regression test to \texttt{test\_zipfs.py}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\hypertarget{testing-coverage}{%
\section{Test Coverage}\label{testing-coverage}}

How much of our code do the tests we have written check?
More importantly,
what parts of our code \emph{aren't} being tested (yet)?
To find out,
we can use a tool to check their \gref{code coverage}{code\_coverage}.\index{code coverage (of testing)}\index{testing!code coverage}
Most Python programmers use the \texttt{coverage} library,
which we can once again install using \texttt{pip}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{pip}\NormalTok{ install coverage}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Once we have it,
we can use it to run \texttt{pytest} on our behalf:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{coverage}\NormalTok{ run -m pytest}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
===================== test session starts ======================

====================== 4 passed in 0.72s =======================
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{coverage} command doesn't display any information of its own,
since mixing that in with our program's output would be confusing.
Instead,
it puts coverage data in a file called \texttt{.coverage} (with a leading \texttt{.}) in the current directory.
To display that data,
we run:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{coverage}\NormalTok{ report -m}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Name            Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
---------------------------------------------
countwords.py      20      8    60%   19-21, 25-31
plotcounts.py      46     27    41%   41-47, 67-69, 74-90, 94-104
test_zipfs.py      32      0   100%
utilities.py        7      4    43%   24-27
---------------------------------------------
TOTAL             105     39    63%
\end{verbatim}

This summary shows us that
some lines of \texttt{countwords.py} or \texttt{plotcounts.py}
were not executed when we ran the tests:
in fact,
only 60\% and 41\% of the lines were run respectively.
This makes sense,
since much of the code in those scripts
is devoted to handling command line arguments or file I/O
rather than the word counting and parameter estimation functionality
that our unit, integration and regression tests focus on.

To make sure that's the case,
we can get a more complete report by running \texttt{coverage\ html} at the command line
and opening \texttt{htmlcov/index.html}.
Clicking on the name of our \texttt{countwords.py} script, for instance,
produces the colorized line-by-line display shown in Figure~\ref{fig:python-coverage}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/testing/python-coverage} 

}

\caption{Example of Python code coverage report.}\label{fig:python-coverage}
\end{figure}

This output confirms that all lines relating to word counting were tested,
but not any of the lines related to argument handling or I/O.

Is this good enough?
The answer depends on what the software is being used for and by whom.
If it is for a safety-critical application such as a medical device,
we should aim for 100\% code coverage,
i.e.,
every single line in the application should be tested.
In fact,
we should probably go further and aim for 100\% \gref{path coverage}{path\_coverage}
to ensure that every possible path through the code has been checked.
Similarly,
if the software has become popular and is being used by thousands of researchers all over the world,
we should probably check that it's not going to embarrass us.

But most of us don't write software that people's lives depend on,
or that is in a \enquote{top 100} list,
so requiring 100\% code coverage is like asking for ten decimal places of accuracy
when checking the voltage of a household electrical outlet.
We always need to balance the effort required to create tests
against the likelihood that those tests will uncover useful information.
We also have to accept that no amount of testing
can prove a piece of software is completely correct.
A function with only two numeric arguments has 2\textsuperscript{128} possible inputs.
Even if we could write the tests,
how could we be sure we were checking the result of each one correctly?

Luckily,
we can usually put test cases into groups.
For example,
when testing a function that summarizes a table full of data,
it's probably enough to check that it handles table with:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  no rows
\item
  only one row
\item
  many identical rows
\item
  rows having keys that are supposed to be unique, but aren't
\item
  rows that contain nothing but missing values
\end{itemize}

Some projects develop \gref{checklists}{checklist} like this one\index{testing!checklist}
to remind programmers what they ought to test.
These checklists can be a bit daunting for newcomers,
but they are a great way to pass on hard-earned experience.

\hypertarget{testing-ci}{%
\section{Continuous Integration}\label{testing-ci}}

Now that we have a set of tests,
we could run \texttt{pytest} every now and again to check our code.
This is probably sufficient for short-lived projects,
but if several people are involved,
or if we are making changes over weeks or months,
we might forget to run the tests
or it might be difficult to identify which change is responsible for a test failure.

The solution is \gref{continuous integration}{continuous\_integration} (CI),\index{continuous integration}\index{CI (continuous integration)}
which runs tests automatically whenever a change is made.\index{testing!continuous integration}
CI tells developers immediately if changes have caused problems,
which makes them much easier to fix.
CI can also be set up to run tests with several different configurations of the software
or on several different operating systems,
so that a programmer using Windows
can be warned that a change breaks things for Mac users and vice versa.

One popular CI tool is \href{https://travis-ci.org/}{Travis~CI},
which integrates well with
\href{https://github.com}{GitHub}.\index{continuous integration!use with version control}\index{version control!and continuous integration}
If Travis~CI has been set up,
then every time a change is committed to a GitHub repository,
Travis~CI creates a fresh environment,
makes a fresh clone of the repository (Section~\ref{git-advanced-fork}),
and runs whatever commands the project's managers have set up.

To set up CI for a project, we must:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Create an account on \href{https://travis-ci.org/}{Travis~CI} (if we don't already have one).
\item
  Link our Travis~CI account to our GitHub account (if we haven't done so already).
\item
  Tell Travis~CI to watch the repository that contains our project.
\end{enumerate}

Creating an account with an online service is probably a familiar process,
but linking our Travis~CI account to our GitHub account may be something new.
We only have to do this once
to allow Travis~CI to access all our GitHub repositories,
but we should always be careful when giving sites access to other sites,
and only trust well-established and widely-used services.

Once we have created an account,
we can tell Travis CI which repository we want it to watch
by clicking the \enquote{+} next to the \enquote{My Repositories} link
on the left-hand side of the Travis~CI homepage (Figure~\ref{fig:testing-add-repo}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/testing/travis-add-repo} 

}

\caption{Click to add a new GitHub repository to Travis CI.}\label{fig:testing-add-repo}
\end{figure}

To add the GitHub repository we have been using throughout the course,
find it in the repository list
and toggle the switch so that it turns green
(Figure~\ref{fig:testing-list-repos}).
If the repository doesn't show up,
re-synchronize the list using the green \enquote{Sync account} button on the left sidebar.
If it still doesn't appear,
the repository may belong to someone else or be private.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/testing/travis-list-repos} 

}

\caption{Find Zipf's Law repository and switch it on.}\label{fig:testing-list-repos}
\end{figure}

The next step is to tell Travis~CI what we want it to do
by creating a file called \texttt{.travis.yml}.
(The leading \texttt{.} in the name hides the file from casual listings on Mac or Linux,
but not on Windows.)
This file must be in the root directory of the repository,
and is written in \gref{YAML}{yaml\_glossary}
(Section~\ref{config-formats} and Appendix~\ref{yaml}).
For our project,
we add the following lines:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{language}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ python}

\FunctionTok{python}\KeywordTok{:}
\KeywordTok{-}\AttributeTok{ }\StringTok{"3.6"}

\FunctionTok{script}\KeywordTok{:}
\KeywordTok{-}\AttributeTok{ pytest}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{language} key tells Travis~CI which programming language to use,
so that it knows which of its standard \gref{virtual machines}{virtual\_machine} to use\index{continuous integration!use of virtual machines}
as a starting point for the project.
The \texttt{python} key specifies the version or versions of Python to use,
while the \texttt{script} key lists the commands to run---in this case, \texttt{pytest}.
We can now go ahead and push the \texttt{.travis.yml} file to GitHub.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ add .travis.yml}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ commit -m }\StringTok{"Initial commit of travis configuration file"}

\end{verbatim}

When this commit reaches GitHub,
that site notifies Travis~CI that the repository has changed.
Travis~CI then follows the instructions in \texttt{.travis.yml}
and reports whether the build passed (shown in green)
or produced warnings or errors (shown in red).
To create this report, Travis~CI has:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Created a new Linux virtual machine.
\item
  Installed the desired version of Python.
\item
  Ran the commands below the \texttt{script} key.
\item
  Reported the results at \texttt{https://travis-ci.org/USER/REPO},
  where \texttt{USER/REPO}
  identifies the repository for a given user.
\end{enumerate}

In this case,
we can see that the build failed (Figure~\ref{fig:testing-build-fail}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/testing/travis-build-fail} 

}

\caption{Travis build overview (build failed).}\label{fig:testing-build-fail}
\end{figure}

Scrolling down to read the job log in detail,
it says that it \enquote{could not locate requirements.txt.}
This happens because the Python scripts that are run when \texttt{pytest} is executed
(i.e.~\texttt{test\_zipfs.py}, \texttt{plotcounts.py}, \texttt{countwords.py} and \texttt{utilities.py})
import a number of packages that don't come with the
\href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/}{Python Standard Library}.
To fix this problem,
we need to do two things.
The first is to add an \texttt{install} key to \texttt{.travis.yml}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{language}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ python}

\FunctionTok{python}\KeywordTok{:}
\KeywordTok{-}\AttributeTok{ }\StringTok{"3.6"}

\FunctionTok{install}\KeywordTok{:}
\KeywordTok{-}\AttributeTok{ pip install -r requirements.txt}

\FunctionTok{script}\KeywordTok{:}
\KeywordTok{-}\AttributeTok{ pytest}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The second is to create \texttt{requirements.txt},
which lists the libraries that need to be installed:

\begin{verbatim}
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scipy
pytest
pyyaml
\end{verbatim}

We commit these changes to GitHub:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ add .travis.yml requirements.txt}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ commit -m }\StringTok{"Adding requirements"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

To https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git
   1f0590b..71084f7  master -> master
\end{verbatim}

Travis~CI automatically runs again.
This time our tests pass and the build completes successfully
(Figure~\ref{fig:testing-build-pass}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/testing/travis-build-pass} 

}

\caption{Travis build overview (build succeeded).}\label{fig:testing-build-pass}
\end{figure}

This example shows one of the other benefits of CI:
it forces us to be explicit about what we are doing and how we do it,
just as writing a Makefile forces us to be explicit about exactly how we produce results (Zampetti et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Zamp2020}{2020}).

\hypertarget{testing-tdd}{%
\section{When to Write Tests}\label{testing-tdd}}

We have now met the three major types of test: unit, integration and regression.
At what point in the code development process should we write these?
The answer depends on who you ask.

Many programmers are passionate advocates of a practice called
\gref{test-driven development}{tdd}
(TDD).\index{test-driven development}\index{testing!test-driven development}\index{TDD (test-driven development)}
Rather than writing code and then writing tests,
they write the tests first and then write just enough code to make those tests pass.
Once the code is working,
they clean it up (Appendix~\ref{style-refactor}) and then move on to the next task.
TDD's advocates claim that this leads to better code because:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Writing tests clarifies what the code is actually supposed to do.
\item
  It eliminates \gref{confirmation bias}{confirmation\_bias}.
  If someone has just written a function,
  they are predisposed to want it to be right,
  so they will bias their tests towards proving that it is correct
  instead of trying to uncover errors.
\item
  Writing tests first ensures that they actually get written.
\end{enumerate}

These arguments are plausible.
However,
studies such as Fucci et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Fucc2016}{2016}) and Fucci et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Fucc2017}{2017}) don't support them:
in practice,
writing tests first or last doesn't appear to affect productivity.
What \emph{does} have an impact is working in small, interleaved increments,
i.e.,
writing just a few lines of code and testing it before moving on
rather than writing several pages of code and then spending hours on testing.

So how do most data scientists figure out if their software is doing the right thing?
The answer is spot checks:
each time they produce an intermediate or final result,
they scan a table, create a chart, or inspect some summary statistics
to see if everything looks OK.
Their heuristics are usually easy to state,
like \enquote{there shouldn't be NAs at this point} or \enquote{the age range should be reasonable},
but applying those heuristics to a particular analysis always depends on
their evolving insight into the data in question.

By analogy with test-driven development,
we could call this process \enquote{checking-driven development}.
Each time we add a step to our pipeline and look at its output,
we can also add a check of some kind to the pipeline to ensure that
what we are checking for remains true as the pipeline evolves or is run on other data.
Doing this helps reusability---it's amazing how often a one-off analysis
winds up being used many times---but the real goal is comprehensibility.
If someone can get our code and data,
then runs the code on the data,
and gets the same result that we did,
then our computation is reproducible,
but that doesn't mean they can understand it.
Comments help
(either in the code or as blocks of prose in a \gref{computational notebook}{computational\_notebook}),
but they won't check that assumptions and invariants hold.
And unlike comments,
runnable assertions can't fall out of step with what the code is actually doing.

\hypertarget{testing-summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{testing-summary}}

Testing data analysis pipelines is often harder than testing mainstream software applications,
since data analysts often don't know what the right answer is (Braiek and Khomh \protect\hyperlink{ref-Brai2018}{2018}).
(If we did,
we would have submitted our report and moved on to the next problem already.)
The key distinction is the difference between \gref{validation}{validation},
which asks whether the specification is correct,
and \gref{verification}{verification},
which asks whether we have met that specification.
The difference between them is the difference between
building the right thing and building something right;
the practices introduced in this chapter will help with both.

\hypertarget{testing-ex-rectangles}{%
\subsection{Rectangle normalization}\label{testing-ex-rectangles}}

A rectangle can be described using a tuple of four cartesian coordinates \texttt{(x0,\ y0,\ x1,\ y1)},
where \texttt{(x0,\ y0)} represents the lower left corner and \texttt{(x1,\ y1)} the upper right.
In order to do some calculations,
suppose we need to be able to normalize rectangles so that the lower left corner
is at the origin (i.e.~\texttt{(x0,\ y0)\ =\ (0,\ 0)}) and the longest side is 1.0 units long.
This function does that:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ normalize_rectangle(rect):}
    \CommentTok{"""Normalizes a rectangle so that it is at the origin}
\CommentTok{    and 1.0 units long on its longest axis.}
\CommentTok{    Input should be of the format (x0, y0, x1, y1).}
\CommentTok{    (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) define the lower left and}
\CommentTok{    upper right corners of the rectangle, respectively."""}

    \CommentTok{# insert preconditions}
\NormalTok{    x0, y0, x1, y1 }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ rect}
    \CommentTok{# insert preconditions}

\NormalTok{    dx }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ x1 }\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{ x0}

\NormalTok{        upper_x, upper_y }\OperatorTok{=} \FloatTok{1.0}\NormalTok{, scaled}
    \ControlFlowTok{else}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{        scaled }\OperatorTok{=} \BuiltInTok{float}\NormalTok{(dx) }\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{ dy}
\NormalTok{        upper_x, upper_y }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ scaled, }\FloatTok{1.0}

    \CommentTok{# insert postconditions here}

    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ (}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, upper_x, upper_y)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In order to answer the following questions,
cut and paste the \texttt{normalize\_rectangle} function into a new file called \texttt{geometry.py} and
save that file in a new directory called \texttt{exercises}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  To ensure that the inputs to \texttt{normalize\_rectangle} are valid,
  add \gref{preconditions}{precondition} to check that:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{rect} contains 4 coordinates,
\item
  the width of the rectangle is a positive, non-zero value (i.e.~\texttt{x0\ \textless{}\ x1}), and
\item
  the height of the rectangle is a positive, non-zero value (i.e.~\texttt{y0\ \textless{}\ y1}).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  If the normalization calculation has worked correctly,
  the new \texttt{x1} coordinate will lie between 0 and 1 (i.e.~\texttt{0\ \textless{}\ upper\_x\ \textless{}=\ 1.0}).
  Add a \gref{postcondition}{postcondition} to check that this is true.
  Do the same for the new \texttt{y1} coordinate, \texttt{upper\_y}.
\end{enumerate}

Running \texttt{normalize\_rectangle} for a short, wide rectangle should pass your new
preconditions and postconditions:

\hypertarget{testing-ex-random}{%
\subsection{Testing with randomness}\label{testing-ex-random}}

Programs that rely on random numbers are impossible to test
because there's (deliberately) no way to predict their output.
Luckily, computer programs don't actually use random numbers:
they use a \gref{pseudo-random number generator}{prng} (PRNG)
that produces values in a repeatable but unpredictable way.
Given the same initial \gref{seed}{seed},
a PRNG will always produce the same sequence of values.
How can we use this fact when testing programs that rely on pseudo-random numbers?

\hypertarget{testing-ex-relative-error}{%
\subsection{Testing with relative error}\label{testing-ex-relative-error}}

If E is the expected result of a function and A is the actual value it produces,
the \gref{relative error}{relative\_error} is \texttt{abs((A-E)/E)}.
This means that if we expect the results of tests to be 2, 1, and 0,
and we actually get 2.1, 1.1, and 0.1
the relative errors are 5\%, 10\%, and infinity.
Why does this seem counter-intuitive,
and what might be a better way to measure error in this case?

\chapter{Handling Errors}\label{errors}}

\begin{quote}
\enquote{When Mister Safety Catch Is Not On, Mister Crossbow Is Not Your Friend.}

--- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}
\end{quote}

We are imperfect people living in an imperfect world.
People will misunderstand how to use our programs,
and even if we test thoroughly as described in the previous chapter,
those programs might still contain bugs.
We should therefore plan from the start to detect and handle errors.

Something that goes wrong while a program is running
is sometimes referred to as an \gref{exception}{exception} from normal behavior.\index{exception}
Generally speaking,
we distinguish between two types of errors/exceptions.
\gref{Internal errors}{internal\_error},\index{error!internal}\index{internal error}
are mistakes in the program itself,
such as calling a function with \texttt{None} instead of a list.
\gref{External errors}{external\_error}\index{external error} are usually caused
by interactions between the program and the outside world:
a user may mis-type a filename,
the network might be down,
and so on.

When an internal error occurs,
the only thing we can do in most cases is report it and halt the program.
If a function has been passed \texttt{None} instead of a valid list,
for example,
the odds are good that one of our data structures is corrupted.
We can try to guess what the problem is and take corrective action,
but our guess will often be wrong
and our attempt to correct the problem might actually make things worse.
When an external error occurs on the other hand,
we don't always want the program to stop.
If a user mis-types her password,
handling the error by prompting her to try again
would be friendlier than halting and requiring her to restart the program.

This chapter looks at how we can raise, catch and handle errors.
We consider how to write useful error messages,
and how to make our programs log those messages
along with other useful information as they are running,
so that it's easier to figure out what happened when something goes wrong.

\hypertarget{errors-exceptions}{%
\section{Exceptions}\label{errors-exceptions}}

Most modern programming languages use exceptions for error handling.
As the name suggests,
an exception is a way to represent an exceptional or unusual occurrence
that doesn't fit neatly into the program's expected operation.
The code below uses exceptions to report attempts to divide by zero:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ denom }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ [}\OperatorTok{-}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{]:}
    \ControlFlowTok{try}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{        result }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{denom}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f'1/}\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{denom}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{ == }\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{result}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{'}\NormalTok{)}
    \ControlFlowTok{except}\NormalTok{:}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f'Cannot divide by }\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{denom}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
1/-5 == -0.2
Cannot divide by 0
1/5 == 0.2
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{try}/\texttt{except} looks like \texttt{if}/\texttt{else} and works in a similar fashion.
If nothing unexpected happens inside the \texttt{try} block,
the \texttt{except} block isn't run (Figure~\ref{fig:errors-control-flow}).
If something goes wrong inside the \texttt{try},
on the other hand,
the program jumps immediately to the \texttt{except}.
This is why the \texttt{print} statement inside the \texttt{try} doesn't run when \texttt{denom} is 0:
as soon as Python tries to calculate \texttt{1/denom},
it skips directly to the code under \texttt{except}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{figures/errors/exceptions} 

}

\caption{Exception control flow.}\label{fig:errors-control-flow}
\end{figure}

We often want to know exactly what went wrong,
so Python and other languages store information about the error
in an object (which is also called an exception).
We can \gref{catch}{catch\_exception} an exception and inspect it as follows:\index{exception!catch}\index{catch exception}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ denom }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ [}\OperatorTok{-}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{]:}
    \ControlFlowTok{try}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{        result }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{denom}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f'1/}\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{denom}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{ == }\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{result}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{'}\NormalTok{)}
    \ControlFlowTok{except} \PreprocessorTok{Exception} \ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ error:}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f'}\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{denom}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{ has no reciprocal: }\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{error}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
1/-5 == -0.2
0 has no reciprocal: division by zero
1/5 == 0.2
\end{verbatim}

We can use any variable name we like instead of \texttt{error};
Python will assign the exception object to that variable
so that we can do things with it in the \texttt{except} block.

Python also allows us to specify what kind of exception we want to catch.
For example,
we can write code to handle out-of-range indexing and division by zero separately:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{numbers }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [}\OperatorTok{-}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{]}
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ i }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ [}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{]:}
    \ControlFlowTok{try}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{        denom }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ numbers[i]}
\NormalTok{        result }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{denom}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f'1/}\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{denom}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{ == }\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{result}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{'}\NormalTok{)}
    \ControlFlowTok{except} \PreprocessorTok{IndexError} \ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ error:}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f'index }\SpecialCharTok{\{i\}}\SpecialStringTok{ out of range'}\NormalTok{)}
    \ControlFlowTok{except} \PreprocessorTok{ZeroDivisionError} \ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ error:}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f'}\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{denom}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{ has no reciprocal: }\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{error}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
1/-5 == -0.2
0 has no reciprocal: division by zero
1/5 == 0.2
index 3 out of range
\end{verbatim}

Exceptions are organized in a hierarchy:\index{exception!hierarchy}
for example,
\texttt{FloatingPointError}, \texttt{OverflowError}, and \texttt{ZeroDivisionError}
are all special cases of \texttt{ArithmeticError},
so an \texttt{except} that catches the latter will catch all three of the former,
but an \texttt{except} that catches an \texttt{OverflowError}
\emph{won't} catch a \texttt{ZeroDivisionError}.
The Python documentation describes all of \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html\#exception-hierarchy}{the built-in exception types};
in practice,
the ones that people handle most often are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{ArithmeticError}:
  something has gone wrong in a calculation.
\item
  \texttt{IndexError} and \texttt{KeyError}:
  something has gone wrong indexing a list or lookup something up in a dictionary.
\item
  \texttt{OSError}:
  thrown when a file is not found,
  the program doesn't have permission to read it,
  and so on.
\end{itemize}

So where do exceptions come from?
The answer is that programmers can \gref{raise}{raise\_exception} them explicitly:\index{exception!raise}\index{raise exception}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ number }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ [}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{-1}\NormalTok{]:}
    \ControlFlowTok{try}\NormalTok{:}
        \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ number }\OperatorTok{<} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{:}
            \ControlFlowTok{raise} \PreprocessorTok{ValueError}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f'no negatives: }\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{number}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{'}\NormalTok{)}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(number)}
    \ControlFlowTok{except} \PreprocessorTok{ValueError} \ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ error:}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f'exception: }\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{error}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
1
0
exception: no negatives: -1
\end{verbatim}

We can define our own exception types,
and many libraries do,
but the built-in types are enough to cover common cases.

One final note is that exceptions don't have to be handled where they are raised.
In fact,
their greatest strength is that they allow long-range error handling.
If an exception occurs inside a function and there is no \texttt{except} for it there,
Python checks to see if whoever called the function is willing to handle the error.
It keeps working its way up through the \gref{call stack}{call\_stack}\index{call stack}
until it finds a matching \texttt{except}.
If there isn't one,
Python takes care of the exception itself.
The example below relies on this:
the second call to \texttt{sum\_reciprocals} tries to divide by zero,
but the exception is caught in the calling code
rather than in the function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ sum_reciprocals(values):}
\NormalTok{    result }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{0}
    \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ v }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ values:}
\NormalTok{        result }\OperatorTok{+=} \DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{v}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ result}

\NormalTok{numbers }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [}\OperatorTok{-}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]}
\ControlFlowTok{try}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{    one_over }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ sum_reciprocals(numbers)}
\ControlFlowTok{except} \PreprocessorTok{ArithmeticError} \ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ error:}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f'Error trying to sum reciprocals: }\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{error}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Error trying to sum reciprocals: division by zero
\end{verbatim}

This behavior is designed to support a pattern called \enquote{throw low, catch high}:
write most of your code without exception handlers,
since there's nothing useful you can do in the middle of a small utility function,
but put a few handlers in the uppermost functions of your program
to catch and report all errors.

We can now go ahead and add error handling to our Zipf's Law code.
Some is already built in:
for example,
if we try to read a file that does not exist,
the \texttt{open} function throws a \texttt{FileNotFoundError}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/collate.py results/none.csv results/dracula.csv}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bin/collate.py", line 27, in <module>
    main(args)
  File "bin/collate.py", line 17, in main
    with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'results/none.csv'
\end{verbatim}

But what happens if we try to read a file that exists,
but was not created by \texttt{countwords.py}?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/collate.py Makefile}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

  File "bin/collate.py", line 10, in update_counts
    for word, count in csv.reader(reader):
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)
\end{verbatim}

This error is hard to understand,
even if we are familiar with the code's internals.
Our program should therefore check that the input files are CSV files,
and if not,
raise an error with a useful explanation to what went wrong.
We could achieve this by wrapping the call to \texttt{open} in a \texttt{try/except} clause:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ fname }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ args.infiles:}
    \ControlFlowTok{try}\NormalTok{:}
        \ControlFlowTok{with} \BuiltInTok{open}\NormalTok{(fname, }\StringTok{'r'}\NormalTok{) }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ reader:}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

This is definitely more informative than before.
However,
\emph{all} \texttt{ValueErrors} that are raised when trying to open a file
will result in this error message,
including those raised when we actually do use a CSV file as input.
A more precise approach in this case would be to throw an exception
only if some other kind of file is specified as an input:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ fname }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ args.infiles:}
    \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ fname[}\OperatorTok{-}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{:] }\OperatorTok{!=} \StringTok{'.csv'}\NormalTok{:}
        \ControlFlowTok{raise} \PreprocessorTok{OSError}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f'}\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{fname}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{ is not a CSV file.'}\NormalTok{)}
    \ControlFlowTok{with} \BuiltInTok{open}\NormalTok{(fname, }\StringTok{'r'}\NormalTok{) }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ reader:}
\NormalTok{        update_counts(reader, word_counts)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{python}\NormalTok{ bin/collate.py Makefile}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bin/collate.py", line 29, in <module>
    main(args)
  File "bin/collate.py", line 18, in main
    raise OSError(f'{fname} is not a CSV file.')
OSError: Makefile is not a CSV file.
\end{verbatim}

This approach is still not perfect:
we are checking that the file's suffix is \texttt{.csv}
instead of checking the content of the file
and confirming that it is what we require.
What we \emph{should} do is check that there are two columns separated by a comma,
that the first column contains strings,
and that the second is numerical.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Kinds of Errors}

The \enquote{\texttt{if} then \texttt{raise}} approach is sometimes referred to as \enquote{look before you leap},
while the \texttt{try/except} approach obeys the old adage that
\enquote{it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission}.
The first approach is more precise,
but has the shortcoming that programmers can't anticipate everything that can go wrong when running a program,
so there should always be an \texttt{except} somewhere
to deal with unexpected cases.

The one rule we should \emph{always} follow is to check for errors as early as possible
so that we don't waste the user's time.
Few things are as frustrating as being told at the end of an hour-long calculation
that the program doesn't have permission to write to an output directory.
It's a little extra work to check things like this up front,
but the larger your program or the longer it runs,
the more useful those checks will be.
\end{quote}

\section{Writing Useful Error Messages}\label{errors-messages}}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/scripting/error-message} 

}

\caption{An unhelpful error message.}\label{fig:errors-error-message}
\end{figure}

The error message shown in Figure~\ref{fig:errors-error-message} is not helpful.\index{error message!writing helpful}
Having \texttt{collate.py} print the message below would be equally unfriendly:

\begin{verbatim}
OSError: Something went wrong, try again.
\end{verbatim}

This message doesn't provide any information on what went wrong,
so it is difficult to know what to change for next time.
A slightly better message would be:

\begin{verbatim}
OSError: Unsupported file type.
\end{verbatim}

This tells us the problem is with the type of file we're trying to process,
but it still doesn't tell us what file types are supported,
which means we have to rely on guesswork or read the source code.
Telling the user \enquote{\emph{filename} is not a CSV file}
(as we did in the previous section)
makes it clear that the program only works with CSV files,
but since we don't actually check the content of the file,
this message could confuse someone who has comma-separated values saved in a \texttt{.txt} file.
An even better message would therefore be:

\begin{verbatim}
OSError: File must end in .csv
\end{verbatim}

This message tells us exactly what the criteria are to avoid the error.

Error messages are often the first thing people read about a piece of software,
so they should therefore be the most carefully written documentation for that software.
A web search for \enquote{writing good error messages} turns up hundreds of hits,
but recommendations are often more like gripes than guidelines
and are usually not backed up by evidence.
What research there is gives us the following rules (Becker et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Beck2016}{2016}):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Tell the user what they did, not what the program did.
  Putting it another way,
  the message shouldn't state the effect of the error,
  it should state the cause.
\item
  Be spatially correct,
  i.e.,
  point at the actual location of the error.
  Few things are as frustrating as being pointed at line 28
  when the problem is really on line 35.
\item
  Be as specific as possible without being or seeming wrong
  from a user's point of view.
  For example,
  \enquote{file not found} is very different from \enquote{don't have permissions to open file} or \enquote{file is empty}.
\item
  Write for your audience's level of understanding.
  For example,
  error messages should never use programming terms more advanced than
  those you would use to describe the code to the user.
\item
  Do not blame the user, and do not use words like fatal, illegal, etc.
  The former can be frustrating---in many cases, \enquote{user error} actually isn't---and
  the latter can make people worry that the program has damaged their data,
  their computer,
  or their reputation.
\item
  Do not try to make the computer sound like a human being.
  In particular, avoid humor:
  very few jokes are funny on the dozenth re-telling,
  and most users are going to see error messages at least that often.
\item
  Use a consistent vocabulary.
  This rule can be hard to enforce when error messages are written by several different people,
  but putting them all in one module makes review easier.
\end{enumerate}

That last suggestion deserves a little elaboration.\index{error message!lookup table}
Most people write error messages directly in their code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ fname[}\OperatorTok{-}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{:] }\OperatorTok{!=} \StringTok{'.csv'}\NormalTok{:}
    \ControlFlowTok{raise} \PreprocessorTok{OSError}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f'}\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{fname}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{: File must end in .csv'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

A better approach is to put all the error messages in a dictionary:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ERRORS }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ \{}
    \StringTok{'not_csv_suffix'}\NormalTok{ : }\StringTok{'}\SpecialCharTok{\{fname\}}\StringTok{: File must end in .csv'}\NormalTok{,}
    \StringTok{'config_corrupted'}\NormalTok{ : }\StringTok{'}\SpecialCharTok{\{config_name\}}\StringTok{ corrupted'}\NormalTok{,}
    \CommentTok{# ...more error messages...}
\NormalTok{    \}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and then only use messages from that dictionary:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ fname[}\OperatorTok{-}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{:] }\OperatorTok{!=} \StringTok{'.csv'}\NormalTok{:}
    \ControlFlowTok{raise} \PreprocessorTok{OSError}\NormalTok{(ERRORS[}\StringTok{'not_csv_suffix'}\NormalTok{].}\BuiltInTok{format}\NormalTok{(fname}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{fname))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Doing this makes it much easier to ensure that messages are consistent.
It also makes it much easier to give messages in the user's preferred language:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ERRORS }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ \{}
  \StringTok{'en'}\NormalTok{ : \{}
    \StringTok{'not_csv_suffix'}\NormalTok{ : }\StringTok{'}\SpecialCharTok{\{fname\}}\StringTok{: File must end in .csv'}\NormalTok{,}
    \StringTok{'config_corrupted'}\NormalTok{ : }\StringTok{'}\SpecialCharTok{\{config_name\}}\StringTok{ corrupted'}\NormalTok{,}
    \CommentTok{# ...more error messages in English...}
\NormalTok{  \},}
  \StringTok{'fr'}\NormalTok{ : \{}
    \StringTok{'not_csv_suffix'}\NormalTok{ : }\StringTok{'}\SpecialCharTok{\{fname\}}\StringTok{: Doit se terminer par .csv'}\NormalTok{,}
    \StringTok{'config_corrupted'}\NormalTok{ : }\SpecialStringTok{f'}\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{config_name}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{ corrompu'}\NormalTok{,}
    \CommentTok{# ...more error messages in French...}
\NormalTok{  \}}
  \CommentTok{# ...other languages...}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The error report is then looked up and formatted as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ERRORS[user_language][}\StringTok{'not_csv_suffix'}\NormalTok{].}\BuiltInTok{format}\NormalTok{(fname}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{fname)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

where \texttt{user\_language} is a two-letter code for the user's preferred language.

\hypertarget{errors-testing}{%
\section{Testing Error Handling}\label{errors-testing}}

An alarm isn't much use if it doesn't go off when it's supposed to.
Equally,
if a function doesn't raise an exception when it should
then errors can easily slip past us.
If we want to check that a function called \texttt{func}
raises an \texttt{ExpectedError} exception\index{testing!error handling}\index{exception!testing}
we can use the following template for a unit test:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{#...set up fixture...}
\ControlFlowTok{try}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{    actual }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ func(fixture)}
    \ControlFlowTok{assert} \VariableTok{False}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'Expected function to raise exception'}
\ControlFlowTok{except}\NormalTok{ ExpectedError }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ error:}
    \ControlFlowTok{pass}
\ControlFlowTok{except} \PreprocessorTok{Exception} \ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ error:}
    \ControlFlowTok{assert} \VariableTok{False}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'Function raised the wrong exception'}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This template has three cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If the call to \texttt{func} returns a value without throwing an exception
  then something has gone wrong,
  so we \texttt{assert\ False} (which always fails).
\item
  If \texttt{func} raises the error it's supposed to
  then we go into the first \texttt{except} branch
  \emph{without} triggering the \texttt{assert} immediately below the function call.
  The code in this \texttt{except} branch could check that
  the exception contains the right error message,
  but in this case it does nothing
  (which in Python is written \texttt{pass}).
\item
  Finally,
  if the function raises the wrong kind of exception
  we also \texttt{assert\ False}.
  Checking this case might seem overly cautious,
  but if the function raises the wrong kind of exception,
  users could easily fail to catch it.
\end{enumerate}

This pattern is so common that \texttt{pytest} provides support for it.
Instead of the eight lines in our original example,
we can write:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ pytest}


\CommentTok{#...set up fixture...}
\ControlFlowTok{with}\NormalTok{ pytest.raises(ExpectedError):}
\NormalTok{    actual }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ func(fixture)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The argument to \texttt{pytest.raises} is the type of exception we expect;
the call to the function then goes in the body of the \texttt{with} statement.
We will explore \texttt{pytest.raises} further in the exercises.

\hypertarget{errors-logging}{%
\section{Reporting Errors}\label{errors-logging}}

Programs should report things that go wrong;\index{error message!reporting}
they should also sometimes report things that go right
so that people can monitor their progress.
Adding \texttt{print} statements is a common approach,
but removing them or commenting them out when the code goes into production is tedious and error-prone.

A better approach is to use a \gref{logging framework}{logging\_framework},\index{logging framework}
such as Python's \texttt{logging} library.
This lets us leave debugging statements in our code
and turn them on or off at will.
It also lets us send output to any of several destinations,
which is helpful when our data analysis pipeline has several stages
and we are trying to figure out which one contains a bug.

To understand how logging frameworks work,
suppose we want to turn \texttt{print} statements in our \texttt{collate.py} program on or off
without editing the program's source code.
We would probably wind up with code like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ LOG_LEVEL }\OperatorTok{>=} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{:}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'Processing files...'}\NormalTok{)}
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ fname }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ args.infiles:}
    \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ LOG_LEVEL }\OperatorTok{>=} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{:}
        \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f'Reading in }\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{fname}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{...'}\NormalTok{)}
    \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ fname[}\OperatorTok{-}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{:] }\OperatorTok{!=} \StringTok{'.csv'}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{        msg }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ ERRORS[}\StringTok{'not_csv_suffix'}\NormalTok{].}\BuiltInTok{format}\NormalTok{(fname}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{fname)}
        \ControlFlowTok{raise} \PreprocessorTok{OSError}\NormalTok{(msg)}
    \ControlFlowTok{with} \BuiltInTok{open}\NormalTok{(fname, }\StringTok{'r'}\NormalTok{) }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ reader:}
        \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ LOG_LEVEL }\OperatorTok{>=} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{:}
            \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialStringTok{f'Computing word counts...'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{        update_counts(reader, word_counts)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\texttt{LOG\_LEVEL} acts as a threshold:
any debugging output at a lower level than its value isn't printed.
As a result,
the first log message will always be printed,
but the other two only in case the user has requested more details
by setting \texttt{LOG\_LEVEL} higher than zero.

A logging framework combines the \texttt{if} and \texttt{print} statements in a single function call
and defines standard names for the \gref{logging levels}{logging\_level}.\index{logging level}
In order of increasing severity,
the usual levels are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{DEBUG}: very detailed information used for localizing errors.
\item
  \texttt{INFO}: confirmation that things are working as expected.
\item
  \texttt{WARNING}: something unexpected happened, but the program will keep going.
\item
  \texttt{ERROR}: something has gone badly wrong, but the program hasn't hurt anything.
\item
  \texttt{CRITICAL}: potential loss of data, security breach, etc.
\end{itemize}

Each of these has a corresponding function:
we can use \texttt{logging.debug}, \texttt{logging.info}, etc. to write messages at these levels.
By default,
only \texttt{WARNING} and above are displayed;
messages appear on \gref{standard error}{stderr}\index{standard error}
so that the flow of data in pipes isn't affected.
The logging framework also displays the source of the message,
which is called \texttt{root} by default.
Thus,
if we run the small program shown below,
only the warning message appears:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ logging}


\NormalTok{logging.warning(}\StringTok{'This is a warning.'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{logging.info(}\StringTok{'This is just for information.'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
WARNING:root:This is a warning.
\end{verbatim}

Rewriting the \texttt{collate.py} example above using \texttt{logging}
yields code that is less cluttered:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ logging}


\NormalTok{logging.info(}\StringTok{'Processing files...'}\NormalTok{)}
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ fname }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ args.infiles:}
\NormalTok{    logging.debug(}\SpecialStringTok{f'Reading in }\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{fname}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{...'}\NormalTok{)}
    \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ fname[}\OperatorTok{-}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{:] }\OperatorTok{!=} \StringTok{'.csv'}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{        msg }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ ERRORS[}\StringTok{'not_csv_suffix'}\NormalTok{].}\BuiltInTok{format}\NormalTok{(fname}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{fname)}
        \ControlFlowTok{raise} \PreprocessorTok{OSError}\NormalTok{(msg)}
    \ControlFlowTok{with} \BuiltInTok{open}\NormalTok{(fname, }\StringTok{'r'}\NormalTok{) }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ reader:}
\NormalTok{        logging.debug(}\StringTok{'Computing word counts...'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{        update_counts(reader, word_counts)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can also configure logging to send messages to a file
instead of standard error\index{configuration!logging}\index{logging configuration}
using \texttt{logging.basicConfig}.
(This has to be done before we make any logging calls---it's not retroactive.)
We can also use that function to set the logging level:
everything at or above the specified level is displayed.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ logging}


\NormalTok{logging.basicConfig(level}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{logging.DEBUG, filename}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'logging.log'}\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{logging.debug(}\StringTok{'This is for debugging.'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{logging.info(}\StringTok{'This is just for information.'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{logging.warning(}\StringTok{'This is a warning.'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{logging.error(}\StringTok{'Something went wrong.'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{logging.critical(}\StringTok{'Something went seriously wrong.'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
DEBUG:root:This is for debugging.
INFO:root:This is just for information.
WARNING:root:This is a warning.
ERROR:root:Something went wrong.
CRITICAL:root:Something went seriously wrong.
\end{verbatim}

By default,
\texttt{basicConfig} re-opens the file we specify in \gref{append mode}{append\_mode};\index{append mode}
we can use \texttt{filemode=\textquotesingle{}w\textquotesingle{}} to overwrite the existing log data.
Overwriting is useful during debugging,
but we should think twice before doing it in production,
since the information we throw away often turns out to be
exactly what we need to find a bug.

Many programs allow users to specify logging levels and log file names as command-line parameters.
At its simplest,
this is a single flag \texttt{-v} or \texttt{-\/-verbose} that changes the logging level from \texttt{WARNING} (the default)
to \texttt{DEBUG} (the noisiest level).
There may also be a corresponding flag \texttt{-q} or \texttt{-\/-quiet} that changes the level to \texttt{ERROR},
and a flag \texttt{-l} or \texttt{-\/-logfile} that specifies a log file name.
To log messages to a file while also printing them,
we can tell \texttt{logging} to use two handlers simultaneously:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ logging}


\NormalTok{logging.basicConfig(}
\NormalTok{    level}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{logging.DEBUG,}
\NormalTok{    handlers}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{[}
\NormalTok{        logging.FileHandler(}\StringTok{"logging.log"}\NormalTok{),}
\NormalTok{        logging.StreamHandler()])}

\NormalTok{logging.debug(}\StringTok{'This is for debugging.'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The string \texttt{\textquotesingle{}This\ is\ for\ debugging\textquotesingle{}} is both printed to standard error
and appended to \texttt{logging.log}.

Libraries like \texttt{logging} can send messages to many destinations;
in production,
we might send them to a centralized logging server
that collates logs from many different systems.
We might also use \gref{rotating files}{rotating\_file}\index{logging framework!rotating file}
so that the system always has messages from the last few hours
but doesn't fill up the disk.
We don't need any of these when we start,
but the data engineers and system administrators
who eventually have to install and maintain your programs
will be very grateful if we use \texttt{logging} instead of \texttt{print} statements,
because it allows them to set things up the way they want with very little work.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Logging Configuration}

Chapter~\ref{config} explained why and how
to save the configuration that produced a particular result.
We clearly also want this information in the log,
so we have three options:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Write the configuration values into the log one at a time.
\item
  Save the configuration as a single record in the log
  (e.g., as a single entry containing \gref{JSON}{json}).
\item
  Write the configuration to a separate file
  and save the filename in the log.
\end{enumerate}

Option~1 usually means writing a lot of extra code to reassemble the configuration.
Option~2 also often requires us to write extra code
(since we need to be able to save and restore configurations as JSON
as well as in whatever format we normally use),
so on balance we recommend option~3.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{errors-summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{errors-summary}}

Most programmers spend as much time debugging as they do writing new code,
but most courses and textbooks only show working code,
and never discuss how to prevent, diagnose, report, and handle errors.
Raising our own exceptions instead of using the system's,
writing useful error messages,
and logging problems systematically
can save us and our users a lot of needless work.

Some of the following exercises will ask you to make further edits to \texttt{collate.py}.

\hypertarget{errors-ex-set-level}{%
\subsection{Set the logging level}\label{errors-ex-set-level}}

Define a new command line flag for \texttt{collate.py} called \texttt{-\/-verbose} (or \texttt{-v})
that changes the logging level from \texttt{WARNING} (the default)
to \texttt{DEBUG} (the noisiest level).

Hint: the following command changes the logging level to \texttt{DEBUG}:

\hypertarget{errors-ex-logging-output}{%
\subsection{Send the logging output to file}\label{errors-ex-logging-output}}

In Exercise~\ref{errors-ex-set-level},
logging information is printed to the screen when the verbose flag is activated.
This is problematic if we want to re-direct the output from \texttt{collate.py} to a CSV file,
because the logging information will appear in the CSV file
as well as the words and their counts.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Edit \texttt{collate.py} so that the logging information is sent to a log file
  called \texttt{collate.log} instead.
  (HINT: \texttt{logging.basicConfig} has an argument called \texttt{filename}.)
\item
  Create a new command line option \texttt{-l} or \texttt{-\/-logfile} so that the user
  can specify a different name for the log file if they don't like
  the default name of \texttt{collate.log}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{errors-ex-exceptions}{%
\subsection{Handling exceptions}\label{errors-ex-exceptions}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Modify the script \texttt{collate.py} so that it catches any exceptions
  that are raised when it tries to open files
  and records them in the log file.
  When you are finished,
  the program should collate all the files it can
  rather than halting as soon as it encounters a problem.
\item
  Modify your first solution to handle nonexistent files
  and permission problems separately.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{errors-ex-error-handling}{%
\subsection{Testing error handling}\label{errors-ex-error-handling}}

In our suggested solution to the previous exercise we modified \texttt{collate.py} to handle
different types of errors associated with reading input files.
The \texttt{main} function in \texttt{collate.py} now reads:

\item
  It is difficult to write a simple unit test for the lines of code dedicated
  to reading input files, because \texttt{main} is a long function that requires
  command line arguments as input. Edit \texttt{collate.py} so that the six lines of
  code responsible for processing an input file appear in their own function
  that reads as follows (i.e.~once you are done, \texttt{main} should call
  \texttt{process\_file} in place of the existing code):

  Add a unit test to \texttt{test\_zipfs.py} that uses \texttt{pytest.raises} to check that

\item
  Add a unit test to \texttt{test\_zipfs.py} that uses \texttt{pytest.raises} to check that

\item
  Use the \texttt{coverage} library (Section~\ref{testing-coverage}) to check that

\item
  Read Appendix~\ref{style-pep8} and explain why we have used capital letters

  Python has three ways to format strings:
  the \texttt{\%} operator, the \texttt{str.format} method, and f-strings (where the \enquote{f} stands for \enquote{format}).
  Look up the documentation for each
  and explain why we have to use \texttt{str.format} rather than f-strings
  for formatting error messages in our catalog/lookup table.
\item
  There's a good chance we will eventually want to use the error messages we've defined
  in other scripts besides \texttt{collate.py}.
  To avoid duplication,
  move \texttt{ERRORS} to the \texttt{utilities} module that was first created in
  Section~\ref{scripting-modules}.

We have now developed, automated, and tested
a workflow for plotting the word count distribution for classic novels.
In the normal course of events,
we would include the outputs from that workflow (e.g., our figures and \(\alpha\) values)
in a research paper or a report for a consulting client.

But modern publishing involves much more than producing a PDF
and making it available on a preprint server such as \href{https://arxiv.org/}{arXiv} or \href{https://www.biorxiv.org/}{bioRxiv}.
It also entails providing the data underpinning the report
and the code used to do the analysis:\index{reproducible research}

\begin{quote}
An article about computational science in a scientific publication
is \emph{not} the scholarship itself,
it is merely \emph{advertising} of the scholarship.

While some reports, datasets, software packages, and analysis scripts
can't be published without violating personal or commercial confidentiality,
every researcher's default should be to make all these as widely available as possible.
Publishing it under an open license (Section~\ref{teams-license}) is the first step;
the sections below describe what else we can do to capture
the \gref{provenance}{provenance} of our data analysis.\index{provenance}

\textbf{Identifying Reports and Authors}

Before publishing anything,
we need to understand how authors and their works are identified.
A \gref{Digital Object Identifier}{doi} (DOI)\index{Digital Object Identifier (DOI)}\index{DOI (Digital Object Identifier)}
is a unique identifier for a particular version of a particular digital artifact
such as a report, a dataset, or a piece of software.
DOIs are written as \texttt{doi:prefix/suffix},
but are often also represented as URLs like \texttt{http://dx.doi.org/prefix/suffix}.
In order to be allowed to issue a DOI,
an academic journal, data archive, or other organization
must guarantee a certain level of security, longevity and access.

An \gref{ORCID}{orcid}\index{ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID)}
is an Open Researcher and Contributor ID.
Anyone can get an ORCID for free,
and should include it in publications
because people's names and affiliations change over time.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{provenance-data}{%
\section{Data Provenance}\label{provenance-data}}

The first step in documenting the data associated with a report
is to determine what (if anything) needs to be published.\index{publishing!data}
If the report involved the analysis of a publicly available dataset
that is maintained and documented by a third party,
it's not necessary to publish a duplicate of the dataset:
the report simply needs to document where to access the data
and what version was analyzed.
This is the case for our Zipf's Law analysis,
since the texts we analyze are available at \href{https://www.gutenberg.org/}{Project Gutenberg}.

It's not strictly necessary to publish intermediate data
produced during the analysis of a publicly available dataset either
(e.g., the CSV files produced by \texttt{countwords.py}),
so long as readers have access to the original data and the code/software used to process it.
However,
making intermediate data available can save people time and effort,
particularly if it takes a lot of computing power to reproduce it
(or if installing the required software is complicated).
For example,
NASA has published
the \href{https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/}{Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis},
which estimates the global average surface temperature
based on thousands of land and ocean weather observations,
because a simple metric of global warming is expensive to produce
and is useful in many research contexts.

If a report involves a new dataset,
such as observations collected during a field experiment,
then that data needs to be published in its raw (unprocessed) form.
The publication of a dataset,
whether raw or intermediate,
should follow the FAIR Principles.

\hypertarget{provenance-data-fair}{%
\subsection{The FAIR Principles}\label{provenance-data-fair}}

The \href{https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/}{FAIR Principles} describe what research data should look like.\index{FAIR Principles}\index{publishing!FAIR Principles}
They are still aspirational for most researchers,
but tell us what to aim for (Goodman et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Good2014}{2014}; Michener \protect\hyperlink{ref-Mich2015}{2015}; Hart et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hart2016}{2016}; Brock \protect\hyperlink{ref-Broc2019}{2019}; Tierney and Ram \protect\hyperlink{ref-Tier2020}{2020}).
The most immediately important elements of the FAIR Principles are outlined below.

\hypertarget{data-should-be-findable.}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Data should be \emph{findable}.}{Data should be findable.}}\label{data-should-be-findable.}}

The first step in using or re-using data is to find it.
We can tell we've done this if:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  (Meta)data is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
  (i.e.~a \gref{DOI}{doi}).
\item
  Data is described with rich metadata
\item
  Metadata clearly and explicitly includes the identifier of the data it describes.
\item
  (Meta)data is registered or indexed in a searchable resource,
  such as the data sharing platforms described in Section~\ref{provenance-data-where}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{data-should-be-accessible.}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Data should be \emph{accessible}.}{Data should be accessible.}}\label{data-should-be-accessible.}}

People can't use data if they don't have access to it.
In practice,
this rule means the data should be openly accessible (the preferred solution)
or that authenticating in order to view or download it should be free.
We can tell we've done this if:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  (Meta)data is retrievable by its identifier
  using a standard communications protocol like HTTP.
\item
  Metadata is accessible even when the data is no longer available.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{data-should-be-interoperable.}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Data should be \emph{interoperable}.}{Data should be interoperable.}}\label{data-should-be-interoperable.}}

Data usually needs to be integrated with other data,
which means that tools need to be able to process it.
We can tell we've done this if:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  (Meta)data uses a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
\item
  (Meta)data uses vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.
\item
  (Meta)data includes qualified references to other (meta)data.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{data-should-be-reusable.}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Data should be \emph{reusable}.}{Data should be reusable.}}\label{data-should-be-reusable.}}

This is the ultimate purpose of the FAIR Principles and much other work.
We can tell we've done this if:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Meta(data) is described with accurate and relevant attributes.
\item
  (Meta)data is released with a clear and accessible data usage license.
\item
  (Meta)data has detailed \gref{provenance}{provenance}.
\item
  (Meta)data meets domain-relevant community standards.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{provenance-data-where}{%
\subsection{Where to archive data}\label{provenance-data-where}}

Small datasets (i.e., anything under 500 MB) can be stored in version control.\index{publishing!data!archiving}
If the data is being used in several projects,
it may make sense to create one repository to hold only the data;
the R community refers to these as \gref{data packages}{data\_package},\index{data package (in R)}\index{publishing!data!package}
and they are often accompanied by small scripts to clean up and query the data.

For medium-sized datasets (between 500 MB and 5 GB),
it's better to put the data on platforms
like the \href{https://osf.io/}{Open Science Framework}, \href{https://datadryad.org/}{Dryad}, and \href{https://figshare.com/}{Figshare},
which will give the dataset a DOI.
Big datasets (i.e., anything more than 5 GB)
may not be ours in the first place,
and probably need the attention of a professional archivist.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Data Journals}

While archiving data at a site like Dryad or Figshare (following the FAIR Principles)
is usually the end of the data publishing process,
there is the option of publishing a journal paper to describe the dataset in detail.\index{publishing!data journal}
Some research disciplines have journals devoted
to describing particular types of data
(e.g., the \href{https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20496060}{Geoscience Data Journal})
and there are also generic data journals
(e.g., \href{https://www.nature.com/sdata/}{Scientific Data}).
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{provenance-code}{%
\section{Code Provenance}\label{provenance-code}}

Our Zipf's Law analysis represents a typical data science project
in that we've written some code
that leverages other pre-existing software packages
in order to produce the key results of a report.\index{publishing!software}
To make a computational workflow like this open, transparent and reproducible
we must archive three key items:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A copy of any \textbf{analysis scripts or notebooks} used to produce the key results
  presented in the report.
\item
  A detailed description of the \textbf{software environment}
  in which those analysis scripts or notebooks ran.
\item
  A description of the \textbf{data processing steps} taken in producing each key result,
  i.e., a step-by-step account of which scripts were executed in what order
  for each key result.
\end{enumerate}

Unfortunately,
librarians, publishers, and regulatory bodies are still trying to determine
the best way to document and archive material like this,
so a widely accepted set of FAIR Principles for research software
are still under development (Lamprecht et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Lamp2020}{2020}).
In the meantime, the best advice we can give is presented below.
It involves adding information about the software environment
and data processing steps to a GitHub repository that contains
the analysis scripts/notebooks,
before creating a new release of that repository and archiving it (with a DOI)
with \href{https://zenodo.org/}{Zenodo}.

\hypertarget{provenance-code-environment}{%
\subsection{Software environment}\label{provenance-code-environment}}

In order to document the software packages used in our analysis,
we should archive a list of the names and version numbers of each software package.
We can get version information for the Python packages we are using by running:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{pip}\NormalTok{ freeze}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
alabaster==0.7.12
anaconda-client==1.7.2
anaconda-navigator==1.9.12
anaconda-project==0.8.3
appnope==0.1.0
appscript==1.0.1
asn1crypto==1.0.1
...
\end{verbatim}

Other command line tools will often have an option like \texttt{-\/-version} or \texttt{-\/-status}
to access the version information.

Archiving a list of package names and version numbers would mean that our
software environment is technically reproducible,
but it would be left up to the reader of the report
to figure out how to get all those packages installed and working together.
This might be fine for a small number of packages with very few dependencies,
but in more complex cases we probably want to make life easier for the reader
(and for our future selves looking to re-run the analysis).
One way to make things easier is to export a description of
a complete conda environment (Section~\ref{packaging-virtualenv};
Appendix~\ref{anaconda-environments}),
which can be saved as YAML using:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{conda}\NormalTok{ env export }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ environment.yml}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cat}\NormalTok{ environment.yml}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
name: base
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - _ipyw_jlab_nb_ext_conf=0.1.0=py37_0
  - alabaster=0.7.12=py37_0
  - anaconda=2019.10=py37_0
  - anaconda-client=1.7.2=py37_0
  - anaconda-navigator=1.9.12=py37_0
  - anaconda-project=0.8.3=py_0
  - appnope=0.1.0=py37_0
  - appscript=1.1.0=py37h1de35cc_0
  - asn1crypto=1.0.1=py37_0
...
\end{verbatim}

That software environment can be recreated on another computer with one line of code:

\begin{verbatim}
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
\end{verbatim}

We can go ahead and add the \texttt{environment.yml} file to our GitHub repository:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ add environment.yml}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ commit -m }\StringTok{"Adding the conda environment file"}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ push origin master}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Container Images}

More complex tools like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)}{Docker}
can install our entire environment
(down to the precise version of the operating system)
on a different computer (Nüst et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Nust2020}{2020}).
However,
their complexity can be daunting,
and there is a lot of debate
about how well (or whether) they actually make research more reproducible in practice.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{provenance-code-steps}{%
\subsection{Data processing steps}\label{provenance-code-steps}}

The second item that needs to be added to our GitHub repository is a description
of the data processing steps involved in each key result.\index{publishing!description of workflow}
Assuming the author list on our report is Amira Khan and Sami Virtanen (Section~\ref{intro-personas}),
we could add a new Markdown file called \texttt{KhanVirtanen2020.md} to the repository
to describe the steps:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{The code in this repository was used in generating the results}
\NormalTok{for the following paper:}

\NormalTok{Khan A and Virtanen S (2020). Zipf's Law in classic english texts.}
\NormalTok{*Journal of Important Research*, 27, 134-139.}

\NormalTok{The code was executed in the software environment described by}
\BaseNTok{`environment.yml`}\NormalTok{. It can be installed using}
\OtherTok{[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{$ conda env create -f environment.yml}

\NormalTok{Figure 1 in the paper was created by running the following at the}
\NormalTok{command line:}
\NormalTok{$ make all}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We should also add this information as an appendix to the report itself.

\hypertarget{provenance-code-scripts}{%
\subsection{Analysis scripts}\label{provenance-code-scripts}}

Later in this book we will package and release our Zipf's Law code
so that it can be downloaded and installed by the wider research community,
just like any other Python package (Chapter~\ref{packaging}).
Doing this is especially helpful if other people might be interested in using and/or extending it,
but often the scripts and notebooks we write to produce a particular figure or table
are too case-specific to be of broad interest.
To fully capture the provenance of the results presented in a report,
these analysis scripts and/or notebooks
(along with the details of the associated software environment and data processing steps)
can simply be archived with a repository like \href{https://figshare.com/}{Figshare} or \href{https://zenodo.org/}{Zenodo},
which specialize in storing the long tail of research projects
(i.e., supplementary figures, data, and code).
Uploading a zip file of analysis scripts to the repository is a valid option,
but more recently the process has been streamlined via direct integration
between GitHub and Zenodo.
As described in \href{https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/}{this tutorial},
the process involves creating a new release of our repository in GitHub
that Zenodo copies and then issues a DOI for (Figure~\ref{fig:provenance-release}).

\hypertarget{provenance-inspectability}{%
\subsection{Reproducibility versus inspectability}\label{provenance-inspectability}}

In most cases,
documenting our software environment, analysis scripts, and data processing steps
will ensure that our computational analysis is reproducible/repeatable
at the time our report is published.\index{reproducible research}
But what about five or ten years later?
As we have discussed,
data analysis workflows usually depend on a hierarchy of packages.
Our Zipf's Law analysis depends on a collection of Python libraries,
which in turn depend on the Python language itself.
Some workflows also depend critically on a particular operating system.
Over time some of these dependencies will inevitably be updated or no longer supported,
meaning our workflow will be documented but not reproducible.

Fortunately,
most readers are not looking to exactly re-run a decade old analysis:
they just want to be able to figure out what was run
and what the important decisions were,
which is sometimes referred to as \gref{inspectability}{inspectability}\index{inspectability}
(Gil et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Gil2016}{2016}; Brown \protect\hyperlink{ref-Brow2017}{2017}).
While exact repeatability has a short shelf-life,
inspectability is the enduring legacy of a well-documented computational analysis.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Your Future Self Will Thank You}

Data and code provenance is often promoted for the good of people
trying to reproduce your work,
who were not part of creating the work in the first place.
Prioritizing their needs can be difficult:
how can we justify spending time for other people
when our current projects need work for the good of the people working on them right now?

Instead of thinking about people who are unknown and unrelated,
we can think about newcomers to our team
and the time we will save ourselves in onboarding them.
We can also think about the time we will save ourselves
when we come back to this project five months or five years from now.
Documentation that serves these two groups well
will almost certainly serve the needs of strangers as well.

\section{Summary}\label{provenance-summary}}

The Internet started a revolution in scientific publishing
that shows no sign of ending.
Where an inter-library loan once took weeks to arrive
and data had to be transcribed from published papers
(if it could be found at all),
we can now download one another's work in minutes:
\emph{if} we can find it and make sense of it.
Organizations like \href{http://ourresearch.org/}{Our Research} are building tools to help with both;
by using DOIs and ORCIDs,
publishing on preprint servers,
following the FAIR Principles,
and documenting our workflow,
we help ensure that everyone can pursue their ideas as we did.

\textbf{What about getting a DOI?}

Creating a GitHub release is also a necessary step
to get a DOI through the Zenodo/GitHub integration
(Section~\ref{provenance-code-scripts}).
We are stopping short of getting the DOI here,
since nobody reading this book needs to formally cite
or archive the example Zipf's Law software we've been developing.
Also, if every reader of the book generated a DOI,
we'd have many DOIs pointing to the same code!

The more software we write,
the more we come to think of programming languages as a way to build and combine libraries.
Every widely-used language now has an online repository
from which people can download and install those libraries.
This lesson shows you how to use Python's tools to create and share libraries of your own.

We will continue with our Zipf's Law project,
which should include the following files:

\hypertarget{packaging-package}{%
\section{Creating a Python Package}\label{packaging-package}}

A package consists of one or more Python source files\index{Python package!structure}
in a specific directory structure
combined with installation instructions for the computer.
Python packages can come from various sources:
some are distributed with Python itself as part of the language's \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/}{standard library},
but anyone can create one,
and there are thousands that can be downloaded and installed from online repositories.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Terminology}

People sometimes refer to packages as modules.\index{Python package vs.\ module}
Strictly speaking,
a module is a single source file,
while a package is a directory structure that contains one or more modules.
\end{quote}

A generic package folder hierarchy looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
pkg_name
├── pkg_name
│   ├── module1.py
│   └── module2.py
├── README.md
└── setup.py
\end{verbatim}

The top-level directory is named after the package.
It contains a directory that is also named after the package,
and that contains the package's source files.
It is initially a little confusing to have two directories with the same name,
but most Python projects follow this convention because
it makes it easier to set up the project for installation.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{\texttt{\_\_init\_\_.py}}

Python packages often contain a file with a special name:
\texttt{\_\_init\_\_.py}\index{\_\_init\_\_.py file (in Python package)}\index{Python package!\_\_init\_\_.py file}
(two underscores before and after \texttt{init}).
Just as importing a module file executes the code in the module,
importing a package executes the code in \texttt{\_\_init\_\_.py}.
Packages \emph{had} to have this file before Python~3.3,
even if it was empty,
but since Python~3.3 it is only needed
if we want to run some code as the package is being imported.
\end{quote}

If we want to make our Zipf's Law software available as a Python package,
we need to follow the generic folder hierarchy.
A quick search of the \href{https://pypi.org/}{Python Package Index (PyPI)}
reveals that the package name \texttt{zipf} is already taken,
so we will need to use something different.
Let's use \texttt{pyzipf} and update our directory names accordingly:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mv}\NormalTok{ ~/zipf ~/pyzipf}
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ~/pyzipf}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mv}\NormalTok{ bin pyzipf}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Updating GitHub}

We won't do it in this case
(because it would break links/references from earlier in the book),
but now that we've decided to name our package is \texttt{pyzipf},
we would normally update the name of our GitHub repository to match.
After changing the name at the GitHub website,
we would need to update our \texttt{git\ remote} so that our
local repository could still be synchronized with GitHub:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ remote set-url origin }
  \ExtensionTok{https}\NormalTok{://github.com/amira-khan/pyzipf.git  }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\end{quote}

Python has several ways to build an installable package.\index{Python package!building}
We will show how to use \href{https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/}{\texttt{setuptools}},\index{setuptools (in Python)}\index{Python!setuptools}
which is the lowest common denominator
and will allow everyone,
regardless of what Python distribution they have,
to use our package.
To use \texttt{setuptools},
we must create a file called \texttt{setup.py} in the directory \emph{above} the root directory of the package.
(This is why we require the two-level directory structure described earlier.)
\texttt{setup.py} must have exactly that name,
and must contain lines like these:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{from}\NormalTok{ setuptools }\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ setup}


\NormalTok{setup(}
\NormalTok{    name}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'pyzipf'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{    version}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'0.1.0'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{    author}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Amira Khan'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{    packages}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{[}\StringTok{'pyzipf'}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{name} and \texttt{author} parameters are self-explanatory.
Most software projects use \gref{semantic versioning}{semantic\_versioning}\index{semantic versioning}\index{Python package!semantic versioning}
for software releases.
A version number consists of three integers X.Y.Z,
where X is the major version,\index{software version number}
Y is the minor version,
and Z is the \gref{patch}{patch} version.\index{patch (of software version)}
Major version zero (0.Y.Z) is for initial development, so we have started with 0.1.0.
The first stable public release would be version 1.0.0,
and in general, the version number is incremented as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Increment \texttt{major} every time there's an incompatible externally-visible change
\item
  Increment \texttt{minor} when adding new functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
  (i.e.~without breaking any existing code)
\item
  Increment \texttt{patch} for backwards-compatible bug fixes that don't add any new features
\end{itemize}

Finally,
we specify the name of the directory
containing the code to be packaged with the \texttt{packages} parameter.
This is straightforward in our case because we only have a single package directory.
For more complex projects,
the \href{https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html\#using-find-packages}{\texttt{find\_packages}} function from \texttt{setuptools}
can automatically find all packages by recursively searching the current directory.

\hypertarget{packaging-virtualenv}{%
\section{Virtual Environments}\label{packaging-virtualenv}}

We can add additional information to our package later,
but this is enough to be able to build it for testing purposes.
Before we do that,
though,
we should create a \gref{virtual environment}{virtual\_environment}\index{virtual environment (in Python)}\index{Python!virtual environment}
to test how our package installs
without breaking anything in our main Python installation.

A virtual environment is a layer on top of an existing Python installation.
Whenever Python needs to find a package,
it looks in the virtual environment before checking the main Python installation.
This gives us a place to install packages that only some projects need
without affecting other projects.

Virtual environments also help with package development:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We want to be able to easily test install and uninstall our package,
  without affecting the entire Python environment.
\item
  We want to answer problems people have with our package with something more helpful than
  \enquote{I don't know, it works for me}.
  By installing and running our package in a completely empty environment,
  we can ensure that we're not accidentally relying on other packages being installed.
\end{itemize}

We can manage virtual environments using \href{https://conda.io/}{\texttt{conda}} (Appendix~\ref{anaconda}).
To create a new virtual environment called \texttt{pyzipf} we run \texttt{conda\ create},\index{virtual environment (in Python)!creating}
specifying the environment's name with the \texttt{-n} or \texttt{-\/-name} flag
and listing \texttt{python} as the base to build on:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{conda}\NormalTok{ create -n pyzipf python}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done

#
# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate pyzipf
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{conda} creates the directory \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/opt/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf},
which contains the subdirectories needed for a minimal Python installation,
such as \texttt{bin} and \texttt{lib}.
It also creates \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/opt/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf/bin/python},
which checks for packages in these directories before checking the main installation.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Anaconda location variations}

The default location for Anaconda differs between operating systems.
Our examples show the default location on MacOS (\texttt{/Users/amira/opt/anaconda3}),
but on Linux it is typically \texttt{/home/amira/anaconda3} and
on Windows it might be \texttt{C:\textbackslash{}Documents\ and\ Settings\textbackslash{}amira\textbackslash{}anaconda3}
or \texttt{C:\textbackslash{}Users\textbackslash{}amira\textbackslash{}anaconda3} (depending on the version of Windows).
During the installation process users can also choose a custom location
if they like (Section \ref{getting-started-install-software}).
\end{quote}

We can switch to the \texttt{pyzipf} environment by running:\index{virtual environment (in Python)!switching}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{conda}\NormalTok{ activate pyzipf}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Once we have done this,
the \texttt{python} command runs the interpreter in \texttt{pyzipf/bin}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{(}\ExtensionTok{pyzipf}\KeywordTok{)}\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{which}\NormalTok{ python}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
/Users/amira/opt/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf/bin/python
\end{verbatim}

Notice that every shell command displays \texttt{(pyzipf)} when that virtual environment is active.
Between Git branches and virtual environments,
it can be very easy to lose track of what exactly we are working on and with.
Prompts like this can make it a little less confusing;
using virtual environment names that match the names of your projects
(and branches, if you're testing different environments on different branches)
quickly becomes essential.

We can now install packages safely.
Everything we install will go into the \texttt{pyzipf} virtual environment
without affecting the underlying Python installation.
When we are done,
we can switch back to the default environment using \texttt{conda\ deactivate}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{(}\ExtensionTok{pyzipf}\KeywordTok{)}\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{conda}\NormalTok{ deactivate}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{which}\NormalTok{ python}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
/usr/bin/python
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{packaging-installing}{%
\section{Installing a Development Package}\label{packaging-installing}}

Let's install our package in this virtual environment.\index{Python package!installation}
First we re-activate it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{conda}\NormalTok{ activate pyzipf}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Next,
we go into the upper \texttt{pyzipf} directory that contains our \texttt{setup.py} file
and install our package:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{(}\ExtensionTok{pyzipf}\KeywordTok{)}\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ~/pyzipf}
\KeywordTok{(}\ExtensionTok{pyzipf}\KeywordTok{)}\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{pip}\NormalTok{ install -e .}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Installing collected packages: pyzipf

\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{-e} option indicates that we want to install the package in \enquote{editable} mode,
which means that any changes we make in the package code are directly available to use
without having to reinstall the package;
the \texttt{.} means \enquote{install from the current directory}.

If we look in \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/opt/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf/lib/python3.8/site-packages/},
we can see the \texttt{pyzipf} package beside all the other locally-installed packages.
If we try to use the package at this stage,
though,
Python will complain that some of the packages it depends on,
such as \texttt{pandas},
are not installed.
We could install these manually,
but it is more reliable to automate this process
by listing everything that our package depends on
using the \texttt{install\_requires} parameter in \texttt{setup.py}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{from}\NormalTok{ setuptools }\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ setup}


\NormalTok{setup(}
\NormalTok{    name}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'pyzipf'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{    version}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'0.1'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{    author}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Amira Khan'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{    packages}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{[}\StringTok{'pyzipf'}\NormalTok{],}
\NormalTok{    install_requires}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{[}
        \StringTok{'matplotlib'}\NormalTok{,}
        \StringTok{'pandas'}\NormalTok{,}
        \StringTok{'scipy'}\NormalTok{,}
        \StringTok{'pyyaml'}\NormalTok{,}
        \StringTok{'pytest'}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We don't have to list \texttt{numpy} explicitly
because it will be installed as a dependency for \texttt{pandas} and \texttt{scipy}.\index{dependency!package}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Versioning Dependencies}

It is good practice to specify the versions of our dependencies
and even better to specify version ranges.
For example, if we have only tested our package on pandas version 1.0.1,
we could put \texttt{pandas==1.1.2} or \texttt{pandas\textgreater{}=1.1.2} instead of just \texttt{pandas}
in the list argument passed to the \texttt{install\_requires} parameter.
\end{quote}

We can now install our package and all its dependencies in a single command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{(}\ExtensionTok{pyzipf}\KeywordTok{)}\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{pip}\NormalTok{ install -e .}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

(The precise output of this command will change
depending on which versions of our dependencies get installed.)

We can now import our package in a script or a \href{https://jupyter.org/}{Jupyter notebook}
just as we would any other package.
For example,
to use the function in \texttt{utilities},
we would write:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{from}\NormalTok{ pyzipf }\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ utilities}


\NormalTok{utilities.collection_to_csv(...)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However,
the useful command-line scripts that we used to count and plot word counts
are no longer accessible directly from the Unix shell.
Fortunately,
the \texttt{setuptools} package allows us to install programs along with the package.\index{Python package!installing programs}
These programs are placed beside those of other packages.
We tell \texttt{setuptools} to do this by defining
\gref{entry points}{entry\_point}:\index{entry point (in Python package)}\index{Python package!entry point}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{from}\NormalTok{ setuptools }\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ setup}


\NormalTok{setup(}
\NormalTok{    name}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'pyzipf'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{    version}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'0.1'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{    author}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Amira Khan'}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{    packages}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{[}\StringTok{'pyzipf'}\NormalTok{],}
\NormalTok{    install_requires}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{[}
        \StringTok{'matplotlib'}\NormalTok{,}
        \StringTok{'pandas'}\NormalTok{,}
        \StringTok{'scipy'}\NormalTok{,}
        \StringTok{'pyyaml'}\NormalTok{,}
        \StringTok{'pytest'}\NormalTok{],}
\NormalTok{    entry_points}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{\{}
        \StringTok{'console_scripts'}\NormalTok{: [}
            \StringTok{'countwords = pyzipf.countwords:main'}\NormalTok{,}
            \StringTok{'collate = pyzipf.collate:main'}\NormalTok{,}
            \StringTok{'plotcounts = pyzipf.plotcounts:main'}\NormalTok{]\})}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The right side of the \texttt{=} operator is the location of a function,
written as \texttt{package.module:function};
the left side is the name we want to use to call this function from the command line.
In this case, we want to call each module's \texttt{main} function,
which as it stands requires an input argument \texttt{args}
containing the command-line arguments given by the user (Section~\ref{scripting-options}).
For example,
the relevant section of our \texttt{countwords.py} program is:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ main(args):}
    \CommentTok{"""Run the command line program."""}
    \ControlFlowTok{with}\NormalTok{ args.infile }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ reader:}
\NormalTok{        word_counts }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ count_words(reader)}
\NormalTok{    util.collection_to_csv(word_counts, num}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{args.num)}


\ControlFlowTok{if} \VariableTok{__name__} \OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{'__main__'}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{    parser }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ argparse.ArgumentParser(description}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{__doc__)}
\NormalTok{    parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'infile'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{argparse.FileType(}\StringTok{'r'}\NormalTok{),}
\NormalTok{                        nargs}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'?'}\NormalTok{, default}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'-'}\NormalTok{,}
                        \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Input file name'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{    parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'-n'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'--num'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{int}\NormalTok{, default}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{None}\NormalTok{,}
                        \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Output only n most frequent words'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{    args }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ parser.parse_args()}
\NormalTok{    main(args)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can't pass any arguments to \texttt{main} when we define entry points in our \texttt{setup.py} file,
so we need to change our script slightly:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ parse_command_line():}
    \CommentTok{"""Parse the command line for input arguments."""}
\NormalTok{    parser }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ argparse.ArgumentParser(description}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{__doc__)}
\NormalTok{    parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'infile'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{argparse.FileType(}\StringTok{'r'}\NormalTok{),}
\NormalTok{                        nargs}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'?'}\NormalTok{, default}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'-'}\NormalTok{,}
                        \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Input file name'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{    parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'-n'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'--num'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{int}\NormalTok{, default}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{None}\NormalTok{,}
                        \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Output only n most frequent words'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{    args }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ parser.parse_args()}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ args}


\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ main():}
    \CommentTok{"""Run the command line program."""}
\NormalTok{    args }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ parse_command_line()}
    \ControlFlowTok{with}\NormalTok{ args.infile }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ reader:}
\NormalTok{        word_counts }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ count_words(reader)}
\NormalTok{    util.collection_to_csv(word_counts, num}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{args.num)}


\ControlFlowTok{if} \VariableTok{__name__} \OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{'__main__'}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{    main()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The new \texttt{parse\_command\_line} function handles the command line arguments,
so that \texttt{main()} no longer requires any input arguments.

Once we have made the corresponding change in \texttt{collate.py} and \texttt{plotcounts.py},
we can re-install our package:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{(}\ExtensionTok{pyzipf}\KeywordTok{)}\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{pip}\NormalTok{ install -e .}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The output looks slightly different than the first run
because \texttt{pip} could re-use some packages saved locally by the previous install
rather than re-fetching them from online repositories.
(If we hadn't used the \texttt{-e} option to make the package immediately editable,
we would have to uninstall it before reinstalling it during development.)

We can now use our commands directly from the Unix shell
without writing the full path to the file

\section{What Installation Does}\label{packaging-installation}}

Now that we have created and installed a Python package,
let's explore what actually happens during installation.\index{Python package!installation}
The short version is that
the contents of the package are copied into a directory that Python will search
when it imports things.
In theory we can \enquote{install} packages by manually copying source code into the right places,
but it's much more efficient and safer to use a tool specifically made for this purpose,
such as \texttt{conda} or \texttt{pip}.

Most of the time,
these tools copy packages into the Python installation's \texttt{site-packages} directory,\index{Python!site-packages directory}
but this is not the only place Python searches.
Just as the \texttt{PATH} environment in the shell contains a list of directories
that the shell searches for programs it can execute (Section~\ref{bash-advanced-vars}),
the Python variable \texttt{sys.path} contains a list of the directories it searches (Section \ref{testing-unit}).
We can look at this list inside the interpreter:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ sys}
\NormalTok{sys.path}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
['',
'/Users/amira/opt/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf/lib/python37.zip',
'/Users/amira/opt/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf/lib/python3.7',
'/Users/amira/opt/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload',
'/Users/amira/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages',
'/Users/amira/opt/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf/lib/python3.7/site-packages',
'/Users/amira/pyzipf']
\end{verbatim}

The empty string at the start of the list means \enquote{the current directory}.
The rest are system paths for our Python installation,
and will vary from computer to computer.

\hypertarget{packaging-distribute}{%
\section{Distributing Packages}\label{packaging-distribute}}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Look But Don't Execute}

In this section we upload the \texttt{pyzipf} package
to TestPyPI and PyPI:

\url{https://test.pypi.org/project/pyzipf}

\url{https://pypi.org/project/pyzipf/}

You won't be able to execute the \texttt{twine\ upload}
commands exactly as shown
(because Amira has already uploaded the \texttt{pyzipf} package),
but the general sequence of commands in this section
is an excellent resource to refer back to when you are
uploading your own packages.
If you want to try uploading your own \texttt{pyzipf} package via \texttt{twine},
you could edit the project name to include your name (e.g.~\texttt{pyzipf-yourname})
and use the TestPyPI repository for the upload.
\end{quote}

An installable package is most useful
if we distribute it so that anyone who wants it
can run \texttt{pip\ install\ pyzipf}\index{Python package!distribution}
and get it.
To make this possible,
we need to use \texttt{setuptools} to create
a \gref{source distribution}{source\_distribution}\index{source distribution (of Python package)}\index{Python package!source distribution}
(known as an \texttt{sdist} in Python packaging jargon):

\begin{Shaded}

These distribution files can now be distributed via \href{https://pypi.org/}{PyPI},
the standard repository for Python packages.
Before doing that,
though,
we can put \texttt{pyzipf} on \href{https://test.pypi.org}{TestPyPI},
which lets us test the distribution of our package\index{Python package!testing distribution}
without having things appear in the main PyPI repository.
We must have an account,
but they are free to create.

The preferred tool for uploading packages to PyPI is called \href{https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{twine},
which we can install with:

\begin{Shaded}

Following the \href{https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi/}{Python Packaging User Guide},
we can now register for an account at the \href{https://test.pypi.org}{TestPyPI website}
and then upload our distributions from the \texttt{dist/} folder
using the \texttt{-\/-repository} option to specify the TestPyPI repository:

\begin{Shaded}

so that it appears on the project webpage.

We have now uploaded both types of distribution,
allowing people to use the wheel distribution if their system supports it
or the source distribution if it does not.
We can test that this has worked

Once again,
\texttt{pip} takes advantage of the fact that some packages already existing on our system
and doesn't download them again.
Once we are happy with our package at TestPyPI,
we can go through the same process to put it on the main \href{https://pypi.org/}{PyPI} repository.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{\texttt{conda} installation packages}

Given the widespread use of \href{https://conda.io/}{\texttt{conda}} for package management,
it can be a good idea to post a \texttt{conda} installation package to
\href{https://anaconda.org/}{Anaconda Cloud}.
The \texttt{conda} documentation has \href{https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs-skeleton.html}{instructions} for quickly building
a \texttt{conda} package for a Python module that is already available on PyPI.
See Appendix~\ref{anaconda} for more information about \texttt{conda} and Anaconda Cloud.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{packaging-document}{%
\section{Documenting Packages}\label{packaging-document}}

Now that our package has been distributed,
we need to think about whether we have provided sufficient documentation.
Docstrings (Section \ref{scripting-docstrings}) and READMEs
are sufficient to describe most simple packages,
but as our code base grows larger
we will want to complement these manually written sections with automatically generated content,
references between functions,
and search functionality.
For most large Python packages,
such documentation is generated using a \gref{documentation generator}{documentation\_generator}
called \href{https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/}{Sphinx},\index{Python package!documentation!Sphinx}
which is often used in combination with a free online hosting service called
\href{https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{Read The Docs}\index{Read The Docs (for Python documentation)}.
In this section we will update our README file with some basic package-level documentation,
before using Sphinx and Read The Docs to host that information online
along with more detailed function-level documentation.
For further advice on writing documentation for larger and more complex packages,
see Appendix \ref{documentation}.

\hypertarget{packaging-readme}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Including package-level documentation in the \texttt{README}}{Including package-level documentation in the README}}\label{packaging-readme}}

When a user first encounters a package,\index{Python package!documentation}
they usually want to know what the package is meant to do,
instructions on how to install it,
and examples of how to use it.
We can include these elements in the \texttt{README.md} file we started in Chapter~\ref{git-advanced}.
At the moment it reads as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cat}\NormalTok{ README.md}

# Zipf's Law

These Zipf's Law scripts tally the occurrences of words in text
files and plot each word's rank versus its frequency.

## Contributors

- Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
- Sami Virtanen <sami@zipf.org>
\end{verbatim}

This file is currently written in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown}{Markdown}\index{Markdown},
but Sphinx uses a format called \gref{reStructuredText}{restructured\_text} (reST),\index{reST (reStructured Text)}\index{reStructured Text (reST)}
so we will switch to that.
Like Markdown,
reST is a plain-text markup format
that can be rendered into HTML or PDF documents
with complex indices and cross-links.
GitHub recognizes files ending in \texttt{.rst} as reST files and displays them nicely,
so our first task is to rename our existing file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{git}\NormalTok{ mv README.md README.rst}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We then make a few edits to the file:
titles are underlined and overlined,
section headings are underlined,
and code blocks are set off with two colons (\texttt{::}) and indented:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{The `}\BaseNTok{`pyzipf`}\NormalTok{` package tallies the occurrences of words in text}
\NormalTok{files and plots each word's rank versus its frequency together }
\NormalTok{with a line for the theoretical distribution for Zipf's Law.}

\NormalTok{Motivation}
\NormalTok{----------}

\NormalTok{Zipf's Law is often stated as an observational pattern seen in the}
\NormalTok{relationship between the frequency and rank of words in a text:}

\hypertarget{packaging-sphinx}{%
\subsection{Creating a web page for documentation}\label{packaging-sphinx}}

Now that we've added package-level documentation to our README file,
we need to think about function-level documentation.
We want to provide users with a list of all the functions available in our package
along with a short description of what they do and how to use them.
We could achieve this by manually cutting and pasting function names and docstrings
from our Python modules (i.e.~\texttt{countwords.py}, \texttt{plotcounts.py}, etc),
but that would be a time consuming process prone to errors as more functions are added over time.
Instead, we can use a \gref{documentation generator}{documentation\_generator}
called \href{https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/}{Sphinx}\index{Python package!documentation!Sphinx}
that is capable of scanning Python code for function names and docstrings
and can export that information to HTML format for hosting on the web.

To start, let's install Sphinx and create a \texttt{docs/} directory at the top of our repository:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{pip}\NormalTok{ install sphinx}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{mkdir}\NormalTok{ docs}
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ docs}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can then run Sphinx's \texttt{quickstart} tool to create a minimal set of documentation
that includes the package-level information in the \texttt{README.rst} file we just created
and the function-level information in the docstrings we've written along the way.
It asks us to specify the project's name,
the name of the project's author,
and a release;
we can use the default settings for everything else.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{sphinx-quickstart}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Welcome to the Sphinx 3.1.1 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter
to accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Selected root path: .

You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx
output. Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root
path, or you separate "source" and "build" directories within the
root path.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OperatorTok{>} \ExtensionTok{Separate}\NormalTok{ source and build directories (y/n) [}\ExtensionTok{n}\NormalTok{]: n}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
The project name will occur in several places in the built
documentation.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OperatorTok{>} \ExtensionTok{Project}\NormalTok{ name: pyzipf}
\OperatorTok{>} \ExtensionTok{Author}\NormalTok{ name(s)}\BuiltInTok{:}\NormalTok{ Amira Khan}
\OperatorTok{>} \ExtensionTok{Project}\NormalTok{ release []: 0.1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
If the documents are to be written in a language other than
English, you can select a language here by its language code.
Sphinx will then translate text that it generates into that
language.

For a list of supported codes, see
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OperatorTok{>} \ExtensionTok{Project}\NormalTok{ language [en]:}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Creating file /Users/amira/pyzipf/docs/conf.py.
Creating file /Users/amira/pyzipf/docs/index.rst.
Creating file /Users/amira/pyzipf/docs/Makefile.
Creating file /Users/amira/pyzipf/docs/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file
/Users/amira/pyzipf/docs/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. HTML,
LaTeX or linkcheck.
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{quickstart} creates a file called \texttt{conf.py} in the \texttt{docs} directory that configures Sphinx.
We will make two changes to that file
so that another tool called \texttt{autodoc} can find our modules (and their docstrings).
The first change relates to the \enquote{path setup} section near the head of the file:

\begin{verbatim}
# -- Path setup -------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in
# another directory, add these directories to sys.path here. If the
# directory is relative to the documentation root, use
# os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
\end{verbatim}

Relative to the \texttt{docs/} directory,
our modules (i.e.~\texttt{countwords.py}, \texttt{utilities.py}, etc) are located in the \texttt{../pyzipf} directory.
We therefore need to uncomment the relevant lines of the path setup section in \texttt{conf.py}
to tell Sphinx where those modules are:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ os}
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ sys}

\NormalTok{sys.path.insert(}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, os.path.abspath(}\StringTok{'../pyzipf'}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We will also change the \enquote{general configuration} section
to add \texttt{autodoc} to the list of Sphinx extensions we want:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{extensions }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [}\StringTok{'sphinx.ext.autodoc'}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

With those edits complete,
we can now generate a Sphinx \texttt{autodoc} script
that generates information about each of our modules
and puts it in corresponding \texttt{.rst} files in the \texttt{docs/source} directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{sphinx-apidoc}\NormalTok{ -o source/ ../pyzipf}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Creating file source/collate.rst.
Creating file source/countwords.rst.
Creating file source/plotcounts.rst.
Creating file source/test_zipfs.rst.
Creating file source/utilities.rst.
Creating file source/modules.rst.
\end{verbatim}

At this point, we are ready to generate our webpage.
The \texttt{docs} sub-directory contains a Makefile that was generated by \texttt{sphinx-quickstart}.
If we run \texttt{make\ html} and open \texttt{docs/\_build/index.html} in a web browser
we'll have a website landing page with minimal documentation (Figure~\ref{fig:packaging-sphinx-landing-page-original}).
If we click on the \texttt{Module\ Index} link we can access the documentation for the individual modules
(Figures~\ref{fig:packaging-sphinx-module-list} and~\ref{fig:packaging-sphinx-module-countwords}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/packaging/landing-page-original} 

}

\caption{The default website landing page.}\label{fig:packaging-sphinx-landing-page-original}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/packaging/module-index} 

}

\caption{The module index.}\label{fig:packaging-sphinx-module-list}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/packaging/module-countwords} 

}

\caption{The countwords documentation.}\label{fig:packaging-sphinx-module-countwords}
\end{figure}

The landing page for the website is the perfect place for the content of our README file,
so we can add the line \texttt{..\ include::\ ../README.rst} to the \texttt{docs/index.rst} file to insert it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Welcome to pyzipf's documentation!}
\NormalTok{==================================}

\NormalTok{.. include:: ../README.rst}

\NormalTok{.. toctree::}
\NormalTok{   :maxdepth: 2}
\NormalTok{   :caption: Contents:}

\NormalTok{Indices and tables}
\NormalTok{==================}

\NormalTok{* }\StringTok{:ref:}\BaseNTok{`genindex`}
\StringTok{* :ref:}\BaseNTok{`modindex`}
\StringTok{* :ref:}\BaseNTok{`search`}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If we re-run \texttt{make\ html},
we now get an updated set of web pages that
re-uses our README as the introduction to the documentation (Figure~\ref{fig:packaging-sphinx-landing-page}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/packaging/landing-page} 

}

\caption{The new landing page showing the contents of README.rst.}\label{fig:packaging-sphinx-landing-page}
\end{figure}

Before going on,
note that Sphinx is not included in the installation requirements in \texttt{requirements.txt} (Section~\ref{testing-ci}).
Sphinx isn't needed to run, develop, or even test our package,
but it is needed for building the documentation.
To note this requirement,
but without requiring everyone installing the package to install Sphinx,
let's create a \texttt{requirements\_docs.txt} file that contains this line
(where the version number is found by running \texttt{pip\ freeze}):

\begin{verbatim}
Sphinx>=1.7.4
\end{verbatim}

Anyone wanting to build the documentation (including us, on another computer)
now only needs run \texttt{pip\ install\ -r\ requirement\_docs.txt}

\hypertarget{packaging-rtd}{%
\subsection{Hosting documentation online}\label{packaging-rtd}}

Now that we have generated our package documentation,
we need to host it online.
A common option for Python projects is \href{https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{Read The Docs},\index{Read The Docs (for Python documentation)}
which is a community-supported site that hosts software documentation free of charge.

Just as continuous integration systems automatically re-test things (Section~\ref{testing-ci}),
Read The Docs integrates with GitHub
so that documentation is automatically re-built
every time updates are pushed to the project's GitHub repository.\index{continuous integration!for documentation}
If we register for Read The Docs with our GitHub account,
we can login at the Read The Docs website and
import a project from our GitHub repository.
Read The Docs will then build the documentation
(using \texttt{make\ html} just as we did earlier)
and host the resulting files.

For this to work,
all of the source files generated by Sphinx
need to be checked into your GitHub repository:
in our case,
this means \texttt{docs/source/*.rst},
\texttt{docs/Makefile},
\texttt{docs/conf.py},
and \texttt{docs/index.rst}.
We also need to create and save a
\href{https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html}{Read the Docs configuration file}
in the root directory of our \texttt{pyzipf} package:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{pwd}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
/Users/amira/pyzipf
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cat}\NormalTok{ .readthedocs.yml}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# .readthedocs.yml
# Read the Docs configuration file
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html
# for details

# Required
version: 2

# Build documentation in the docs/ directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
  configuration: docs/conf.py

# Optionally set the version of Python and requirements required
# to build your docs
python:
  version: 3.7
  install:
    - requirements: requirements.txt
\end{verbatim}

The configuration file uses the now-familiar \gref{YAML}{yaml} format\index{YAML}
(Section~\ref{config-formats} and Appendix~\ref{yaml})
to specify the location of the Sphinx configuration script (\texttt{docs/conf.py})
and the dependencies for our package (\texttt{requirements.txt}).

Amira has gone through this process and the documentation is now available at:

\url{https://pyzipf.readthedocs.io/}

\hypertarget{packaging-software-journals}{%
\section{Software Journals}\label{packaging-software-journals}}

As a final step to releasing our new package,
we might want to give it a \gref{DOI}{doi}\index{DOI (Digital Object Identifier)}\index{Digital Object Identifier (DOI)}
so that it can be cited by researchers.
As we saw in Section~\ref{provenance-code-scripts},
GitHub \href{https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/}{integrates with Zenodo}
for precisely this purpose.

While creating a DOI using a site like Zenodo
is often the end of the software publishing process,
there is the option of publishing
a journal paper to describe the software in detail.
Some research disciplines have journals devoted
to describing particular types of software
(e.g., \href{https://www.geoscientific-model-development.net/}{Geoscientific Model Development}),
and there are also a number of generic software journals such as the
\href{https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/}{Journal of Open Research Software} and
the \href{https://joss.theoj.org/}{Journal of Open Source Software}.
Packages submitted to these journals are typically assessed against a range of criteria
relating to how easy the software is to install
and how well it is documented,
so the peer review process can be a great way to get critical feedback
from people who have seen many research software packages come and go over the years.

Once you have obtained a DOI and possibly published with a software journal,
the last step is to tell users how to cite your new software package.
This is traditionally done by adding a \texttt{CITATION} file\index{CITATION file}\index{project files!CITATION}
to the associated GitHub repository
(alongside \texttt{README}, \texttt{LICENSE}, \texttt{CONDUCT} and similar files discussed in Section~\ref{getting-started-boilerplate}),
containing a plain text citation that can be copied and pasted into email
as well as entries formatted for various bibliographic systems like \href{http://www.bibtex.org/}{BibTeX}.

\begin{Shaded}

\section{Summary}\label{packaging-summary}}

Thousands of people have helped write the software that our Zipf's Law example relies on,
but their work is only useful because they packaged it
and documented how to use it.
Doing this is increasingly recognized as a credit-worthy activity
by universities, government labs, and other organizations,
particularly for research software engineers.
It is also deeply satisfying to make strangers' lives better,
if only in small ways.

\chapter{Finale}\label{finale}}

We have come a long way since we first met Amira, Jun, and Sami in Section~\ref{intro-personas}.
Amira now has her scripts, data sets and reports organized,
in version control,
and on GitHub.
Her work has already paid off:
a colleague spotted a problem in an analysis step,
that impacted five figures in one of her reports.
Because Amira has embraced GitHub,
the colleague could easily suggest a fix through a pull request.
It took Amira some time to regenerate all of the
affected figures, because she had to recall
which code needed to be rerun.
She recognized this as a great reason to embrace Make,
and has added implementing it to her to-do list.

She used to be intimidated by the Unix shell,
but now Amira finds it an essential part of her everyday work:
she uses shell scripts to automate data processing tasks,
she runs her own command line tools she wrote in Python,
and issues countless commands to Git.
Her comfort with the shell is also helping
as she learns how to run her analyses on a remote computing cluster
from Sami.

Sami had experience with Git and Make in software projects from
their undergraduate studies,
but they have a new appreciation for their importance in research projects.
They've reworked their Git and Make workshops to use examples of data pipelines,
and have been getting rave reviews from participants.
Sami has also gained an appreciation
for the importance of provenance
of both data and code in research.
They've been helping their users
by suggesting ways they can make their research more accessible, inspectable and reproducible.

Jun is now working on his first Python package.
He's added better error handling so he and his
users get better information when something goes wrong,
he's implemented some testing strategies to give him and his users confidence his code works, and
he's improved his documentation.
Jun has also added a license, a Code of Conduct and contributing guidelines to his project repo,
and has already had a contribution that fixes some typos in the documentation.

\hypertarget{why-we-wrote-this-book}{%
\section{Why We Wrote This Book}\label{why-we-wrote-this-book}}

Shell scripts,
branching,
automated workflows,
healthy team dynamics---they all take time to learn,
but they enable researchers to get more done in less time and with less pain,
and that's why we wrote this book.
The climate crisis is the greatest threat our species has faced since civilization began.
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown just how ill-prepared we are to deal with problems of that magnitude,
or with the suspicion and disinformation that now poisons every public discussion online.

Every hour that a researcher \emph{doesn't} waste wrestling with software
is an hour they can spend solving a new problem;
every meeting that ends early with a clear decision
frees up time to explain to the public what we actually know and why it matters.
We don't expect this book to change the world,
but we hope that knowing how to write, test, document, package, and share your work
will give you a slightly better chance of doing so.
We hope you have enjoyed reading what we have written;
if so,
we would enjoy hearing from you.

The exercises included in this book represent a wide variety of problems,
from multiple choice questions to larger coding tasks.
It's relatively straightforward to indicate a correct answer for the former,
though there may be unanticipated cases in which the specific software version
you're using leads to alternative answers being preferable.
It's even more difficult to identify the \enquote{right} answer for the latter,
since there are often many ways to accomplish the same task with code.
Here we present possible solutions that the authors generally agree represent \enquote{good} code,

the file/directory names but also additional information such as the file size
and the time of its last modification. If you use both the \texttt{-h} option and the \texttt{-l} option,
this makes the file size \enquote{\textbf{h}uman readable}, i.e.~displaying something like \texttt{5.3K}
instead of \texttt{5369}.

\hypertarget{exercise-refbash-basics-ex-touch}{%
\subsection*{Exercise~\ref{bash-basics-ex-touch}}\label{exercise-refbash-basics-ex-touch}}


The \texttt{touch} command updates a file's timestamp.
If no file exists with the given name, \texttt{touch} will create one.
Assuming you don't already have \texttt{my\_file.txt} in your working directory,
\texttt{touch\ my\_file.txt} will create the file.
When you inspect the file with \texttt{ls\ -l}, note that the size of
\texttt{my\_file.txt} is 0 bytes. In other words, it contains no data.
If you open \texttt{my\_file.txt} using your text editor it is blank.

Some programs do not generate output files themselves, but
instead require that empty files have already been generated.
When the program is run, it searches for an existing file to
populate with its output. The touch command allows you to
efficiently generate a blank text file to be used by such
programs.

The \texttt{-i} option will prompt before (every) removal

only the files that we want to remove.

We start in the \texttt{/Users/amira/data} directory,
containing a single file, \texttt{books.dat}.
We create a new folder called \texttt{doc},
move (\texttt{mv}) the file \texttt{books.dat} to the new folder (\texttt{doc}).
Then we make a copy (\texttt{cp}) of the file we just moved named \texttt{books-saved.dat}.\\
The tricky part here is the location of the copied file.
Recall that \texttt{..} means \enquote{go up a level}, so the copied file is now in \texttt{/Users/amira}.
Notice that \texttt{..} is interpreted with respect to the current working
directory, \textbf{not} with respect to the location of the file being copied.
So, the only thing that will show using ls (in \texttt{/Users/amira/data}) is the \texttt{doc} folder.

When used on a single file,
\texttt{cat} prints the contents of that file to the screen.
In this case,
the contents of \texttt{titles.txt} are sent as input to \texttt{head\ -n\ 5},
so the first five lines of \texttt{titles.txt} is output.
These five lines are used as the input for \texttt{tail\ -n\ 3},
which results in lines 3-5 as output.
This is used as input to the final command,
which sorts them in reverse order.
These results are written to the file \texttt{final.txt},
the contents of which are:

The difference between the versions is whether the code after \texttt{echo}
is inside quotation marks.

Version 2 will allow us to preview the commands.
This prints to screen everything enclosed in the quotation marks,
expanding the loop variable name (prefixed with \texttt{\$}).

The first version redirects the output from \texttt{echo\ analyze\ \$file}
to a file (\texttt{analyzed-\$file}).
This doesn't allow us to preview the commands,
but instead creates files (\texttt{analyzed-\$file}),
containing the text \texttt{analyze\ \$file}.

Version 1 gives the same output on each iteration through

Bash expands the wildcard \texttt{*.txt} to match all files ending in \texttt{.txt}

Version 2 uses \texttt{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}},
which appends the lines to the existing file.
This is preferable because the final \texttt{headers.txt}

One possible solution:

\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{for} \ExtensionTok{sister}\NormalTok{ in Elinor Marianne}
\KeywordTok{do}
    \BuiltInTok{echo} \VariableTok{$sister}\NormalTok{:}

\KeywordTok{done}

\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{-o} option prints only the matching part of a line.

An alternative (but possibly less accurate)
solution is:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{for} \ExtensionTok{sister}\NormalTok{ in Elinor Marianne}
\KeywordTok{do}
    \BuiltInTok{echo} \VariableTok{$sister}\NormalTok{:}

\KeywordTok{done}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This solution is potentially less accurate
because \texttt{grep\ -c} only reports the number of lines matched.
The total number of matches reported by this method
will be lower if there is more than one match per line.

Running a Python statement directly from the command line is useful as a basic calculator
and for simple string operations,
since these commands occur in one line of code.

Amira does not need to make the \texttt{heaps-law} subdirectory a Git repository
because the \texttt{zipf} repository will track everything inside it regardless of how deeply nested.

Amira \emph{shouldn't} run \texttt{git\ init} in \texttt{heaps-law} because nested Git repositories can interfere with each other.
If someone commits something in the inner repository,
Git will not know whether to record the changes in that repository,
the outer one,
or both.

The left button (with the picture of a clipboard)
copies the full identifier of the commit to the clipboard.
In the shell,
\texttt{git\ log} shows the full commit identifier for each commit.

The middle button shows all of the changes that were made in that particular commit;
green shaded lines indicate additions and red lines indicate removals.
We can show the same thing in the shell using \texttt{git\ diff}
or \texttt{git\ diff\ FROM..TO}
(where \texttt{FROM} and \texttt{TO} are commit identifiers).

The right button lets us view all of the files in the repository at the time of that commit.
To do this in the shell,
we would need to check out the repository as it was at that commit
using \texttt{git\ checkout\ ID}, where \texttt{ID} is the tag, branch name, or commit identifier.
If we do this,
we need to remember to put the repository back to the right state afterward.

The answer is (5)-Both 2 and 4.

The \texttt{checkout} command restores files from the repository,
overwriting the files in our working directory.
Answers 2 and 4 both restore the latest version in the repository of the file \texttt{data\_cruncher.sh}.
Answer 2 uses \texttt{HEAD} to indicate the latest,
while answer 4 uses the unique ID of the last commit,
which is what \texttt{HEAD} means.

Answer 3 gets the version of \texttt{data\_cruncher.sh} from the commit before \texttt{HEAD},
which is not what we want.

Answer 1 can be dangerous:
without a filename,
\texttt{git\ checkout} will restore all files in the current directory (and all directories below it)
to their state at the commit specified.
This command will restore \texttt{data\_cruncher.sh} to the latest commit version,
but will also reset any other files we have changed to that version,
which will erase any unsaved changes you may have made to those files.

\hypertarget{exercise-refgit-cmdline-ex-history}{%
\subsection*{Exercise~\ref{git-cmdline-ex-history}}\label{exercise-refgit-cmdline-ex-history}}


The answer is 1.

The command \texttt{git\ add\ motivation.txt} adds the current version of \texttt{motivation.txt} to the staging area.
The changes to the file from the second \texttt{echo} command are only applied to the working copy,
not the version in the staging area.

As a result,
when \texttt{git\ commit\ -m\ "Motivate\ project"} is executed,
the version of \texttt{motivation.txt} committed to the repository is the one from the staging area
with only one line.

However,
the working copy still has the second line.
(\texttt{git\ status} will show that the file is modified.)
\texttt{git\ restore\ motivation.txt} therefore replaces the working copy with
the most recently committed version of \texttt{motivation.txt},
so \texttt{cat\ motivation.txt} prints:

Breaking it down:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Setting the \texttt{PS1} variable defines the primary shell \gref{prompt}{prompt}.
\item
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}w} in a shell prompt string means \enquote{the current directory}.
\item
  The \texttt{+} is a literal \texttt{+} sign between the current directory and the Git branch name.
\item
  The command that gets the name of the current Git branch is in \texttt{\$(...)}.
  (We need to escape the \texttt{\$} as \texttt{\textbackslash{}\$} so Bash doesn't just run it once
  when defining the string.)
\item
  The \texttt{git\ branch} command shows \emph{all} the branches,
  so we pipe that to \texttt{grep} and select the one marked with a \texttt{*}.
\item
  Finally, we remove the first column (i.e., the one containing the \texttt{*})
  to leave just the branch name.
\end{enumerate}

So what's \texttt{2\textgreater{}/dev/null} about?
That redirects any error messages to \texttt{/dev/null},
a special \enquote{file} that consumes input without saving it.
We need that because sometimes we will be in a directory
that isn't inside a Git repository,
and we don't want error messages showing up in our shell prompt.

\emph{None of this is obvious,}
and we didn't figure it out ourselves.
Instead,
we did a search and pasted various answers into \href{http://explainshell.com}{explainshell.com}
until we had something we understood and trusted.

\url{https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore}
ignores 76 files or patterns.
Of those,
we recognized less than half.
Searching online for some of these,
like \texttt{"*.pot\ file"},
turns up useful explanations.
Searching for others like \texttt{var/} does not;
in that case,
we have to look at the category (in this case, \enquote{Python distribution})
and set aside time to do more reading.

\item
  \texttt{git\ diff\ master..same} does not print anything
  because there are no differences between the two branches.
\item
  \texttt{git\ merge\ same\ master} prints \texttt{merging}
  because Git combines histories even when the files themselves do not differ.
  After running this command,
  \texttt{git\ history} shows a commit for the merge.

  Git refuses to delete a branch with unmerged commits
  because it doesn't want to destroy our work.
\item
  Using the \texttt{-D} (capital-D) option to \texttt{git\ branch} will delete the branch anyway.
  This is dangerous because any content that exists only in that branch will be lost.

Some solutions could be:

\tightlist
\item
  Give the team member their own office space so they don't distract others.
\item
  Buy noise cancelling headphones for the employees that find it distracting.

  Re-arrange the work spaces so that there is a \enquote{quiet office} and a regular

We obviously can't say which description fits you best, but:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Use \gref{three sticky notes}{three\_stickies}
  and \gref{interruption bingo}{interruption\_bingo}
  to stop \emph{Anna} from cutting people off.
\item
  Tell \emph{Bao} that the devil doesn't need more advocates,
  and that he's only allowed one \enquote{but what about} at a time.
\item
  \emph{Hediyeh}'s lack of self-confidence will take a long time to remedy.
  Keeping a list of the times she's been right
  and reminding her of them frequently is a start,
  but the real fix is to create and maintain a supportive environment.
\item
  Unmasking \emph{Kenny}'s hitchhiking wll feel like nit-picking,
  but so does the accounting required to pin down other forms of fraud.
  The most important thing is to have the discussion in the open
  so that everyone realizes he's taking credit for everyone else's work
  as well as theirs.
\item
  \emph{Melissa} needs a running partner---someone to work beside her
  so that she starts when she should and doesn't get distracted.
  If that doesn't work,
  the project may need to assign everything mission-critical to someone else
  (which will probably lead to her leaving).
\item
  \emph{Petra} can be managed with a one-for-one rule:
  each time she builds or fixes something that someone else needs,
  she can then work on something she thinks is cool.
  However,
  she's only allowed to add whatever it is to the project
  if someone else will publicly commit to maintaining it.

  By default, Make looks for (and runs) a file called \texttt{Makefile} or \texttt{makefile}.
  If you use another name for your Makefile

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{exercise-refconfig-ex-saveload}{%
\subsection*{Exercise~\ref{config-ex-saveload}}\label{exercise-refconfig-ex-saveload}}


The first step is to add a new command-line argument to tell \texttt{plotcount.py} what we want to do:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if} \VariableTok{__name__} \OperatorTok{==} \StringTok{'__main__'}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{    parser }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ argparse.ArgumentParser(description}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{__doc__)}
    \CommentTok{# ...other options as before...}
\NormalTok{    parser.add_argument(}\StringTok{'--saveconfig'}\NormalTok{, }\BuiltInTok{type}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{str}\NormalTok{, default}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{None}\NormalTok{,}
                        \BuiltInTok{help}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'Save configuration to file'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{    args }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ parser.parse_args()}
\NormalTok{    main(args)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Next, we add three lines to \texttt{main} to act on this option \emph{after} all of the plotting parameters have been set.
For now we use \texttt{return} to exit from \texttt{main} as soon as the parameters have been saved;
this lets us test our change without overwriting any of our actual plots.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ main(args):}
    \CommentTok{"""Run the command line program."""}
    \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ args.style:}
\NormalTok{        plt.style.use(args.style)}
\NormalTok{    set_plot_params(args.plotparams)}
    \CommentTok{# Save plotting configuration.}
    \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ args.saveconfig:}
\NormalTok{        save_configuration(args.saveconfig, mpl.rcParams)}
        \ControlFlowTok{return}
\NormalTok{    df }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ pd.read_csv(args.infile, header}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{None}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{                     names}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'word'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'word_frequency'}\NormalTok{))}
    \CommentTok{# ...carry on producing plot...}


\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ save_configuration(filename, params):}
    \CommentTok{"""Save configuration to a file."""}
    \ControlFlowTok{with} \BuiltInTok{open}\NormalTok{(filename, }\StringTok{'w'}\NormalTok{) }\ImportTok{as}\NormalTok{ reader:}
\NormalTok{        yaml.dump(params, reader)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Finally, we add a target to \texttt{Makefile} to try out our change.
We do the test this way so that we can be sure that
we're testing with the same options we use with the real program;
if we were to type in the whole command ourselves,
we might use something different.
We also save the configuration to \texttt{/tmp} rather than to our project directory
to keep it out of version control's way:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{## test-saveconfig : save plot configuration.}
\DecValTok{test-saveconfig :}
\NormalTok{    python }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{PLOT}\CharTok{)}\NormalTok{ --saveconfig /tmp/test-saveconfig.yml }\CharTok{\textbackslash{}}
\NormalTok{      --plotparams }\CharTok{$(}\DataTypeTok{PARAMS}\CharTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The output is over 400 lines long,
and includes settings for everything from the animation bit rate and the size of y-axis ticks:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OtherTok{!!python/object/new:matplotlib.RcParams}
\FunctionTok{dictitems}\KeywordTok{:}
\AttributeTok{  }\FunctionTok{_internal.classic_mode}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\CharTok{false}
\AttributeTok{  }\FunctionTok{agg.path.chunksize}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\DecValTok{0}
\AttributeTok{  }\FunctionTok{animation.avconv_args}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\KeywordTok{[]}
\AttributeTok{  }\FunctionTok{animation.avconv_path}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ avconv}
\AttributeTok{  }\FunctionTok{animation.bitrate}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\DecValTok{-1}
\AttributeTok{  ...}
\AttributeTok{  }\FunctionTok{ytick.minor.size}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\FloatTok{2.0}
\AttributeTok{  }\FunctionTok{ytick.minor.visible}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\CharTok{false}
\AttributeTok{  }\FunctionTok{ytick.minor.width}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\FloatTok{0.6}
\AttributeTok{  }\FunctionTok{ytick.right}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\CharTok{false}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The beautiful thing about this file is that the entries are automatically sorted alphabetically,
which makes it easy for both human beings and the \texttt{diff} command to spot differences.
This helps reproducibility because any one of these settings might change
in a new release of \texttt{matplotlib},
and any of those changes might affect our plots.
Saving the settings allows us to compare what we had when we did our work
to what we have when we're trying to recreate it,
which in turn gives us a starting point for debugging if we need to.

  Most people seem to find Windows INI files easier to write and read,
  since it's easier to see what's a heading and what's a value.
\item
  However, Windows INI files only provide one level of sectioning,
  so complex configurations are harder to express.
  Thus, while YAML may be a bit more difficult to get started with,
  it will take us further.

The answer depends on whether we are able to make changes to Program~A and Program~B.
If we can,
we can modify them to use overlay configuration
and put the shared parameters in a single file that both programs load.
If we can't do that,
the next best thing is to create a small helper program
that reads their configuration files and checks that common parameters have consistent values.
The first solution prevents the problem;
the second detects it,
which is a lot better than nothing.

\hypertarget{exercise-reftesting-ex-random}{%
\subsection*{Exercise~\ref{testing-ex-random}}\label{exercise-reftesting-ex-random}}


There are three approaches to testing when pseudo-random numbers are involved:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Run the function once with a known \gref{seed}{seed},
  check and record its output,
  and then compare the output of subsequent runs to that saved output.
  (Basically, if the function does the same thing it did the first time, we trust it.)
\item
  Replace the \gref{pseudo-random number generator}{prng} with a function of our own
  that generates a predictable series of values.
  For example,
  if we are randomly partitioning a list into two equal halves,
  we could instead use a function that puts odd-numbered values in one partition
  and even-numbered values in another
  (which is a legal but unlikely outcome of truly random partitioning).
\item
  Instead of checking for an exact result,
  check that the result lies within certain bounds,
  just as we would with the result of a physical experiment.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{exercise-reftesting-ex-relative-error}{%
\subsection*{Exercise~\ref{testing-ex-relative-error}}\label{exercise-reftesting-ex-relative-error}}


This result seems counter-intuitive to many people because relative error is a measure of a single value,
but in this case we are looking at a distribution of values:
each result is off by 0.1 compared to a range of 0--2,
which doesn't \enquote{feel} infinite.
In this case,
a better measure might be the largest \gref{absolute error}{absolute\_error}
divided by the standard deviation of the data.

\item
  The convention is to use \texttt{ALL\_CAPS\_WITH\_UNDERSCORES} when defining global variables.
\item
  Python's f-strings interpolate variables that are in scope:
  there is no easy way to interpolate values from a lookup table.
  In contrast,
  \texttt{str.format} can be given any number of named keyword arguments (Appendix~\ref{style}),
  so we can look up a string and then interpolate whatever values we want.

  51 solicitors were interviewed as the participants.
\item
  Interview data and a data from a database on court decisions.
\item
  This information is not available within the documentation.
  Information on their jobs and opinions are there,
  but the participant demographics are only described within the associated article.
  The difficulty is that the article is not linked within the documentation or the metadata.
\item
  We can search the dataset name and authorname trying to find this.
  A search for \enquote{National Science Foundation (1228602)},
  which is the grant information,
  finds the \href{https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1228602}{grant page}.
  Two articles are linked there,
  but both the DOI links are broken.
  We can search with the citation for each paper to find them.
  The \href{https://www.fmreview.org/fragilestates/meili}{Forced Migration article}
  uses a different subset of interviews and does not mention demographics
  nor links to the deposited dataset.
  The \href{https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3318\&context=bclr}{Boston College Law Review article}
  has the same two problems of different data and no dataset citation.

  Searching more broadly through Meili's work, we can find Meili (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Meil2015}{2015}).
  This lists the dataset as a footnote and reports the 51 interviews
  with demographic data on reported gender of the interviewees.
  This paper lists data collection as 2010-2014,
  while the other two say 2010-2013.
  We might come to a conclusion that this extra year
  is where the extra 9 interviews come in,
  but that difference is not explained anywhere.

  No information on installing ImageMagick or a required version of ImageMagick is provided.

  To re-create the \texttt{conda} environment you would need the file \texttt{my\_environment.yml}.
  Instructions for creating and using the environment are provided in \texttt{README.md}.
\item
  Like \texttt{zipf} the data processing and analysis steps are documented in a \texttt{Makefile}.
  The \texttt{README} includes instructions for re-creating the results using \texttt{make\ all}.
\item
  There doesn't seem to be a DOI for the archived code and data,

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The figshare page includes a \enquote{Software environment} section.
  To re-create the \texttt{conda} environment you would need the file \texttt{environment.yml}.
\item
  \texttt{figure*\_log.txt} are log files for each figure in the paper.
  These files show the computational steps performed in generating the figure,
  in the form of a list of commands executed at the command line.

  \texttt{code.zip} is a version controlled (using git) file directory
  containing the code written to perform the analysis
  (i.e.~it contains the scripts referred to in the log files).
  This code can also be found on GitHub.
\item
  The figshare page itself is the archive, and includes a version history for the contents.

  \texttt{README.md} includes an \enquote{Install requirements} section
  that describes setting up the \texttt{conda} environment using the file \texttt{h3n2\_reassortment.yaml}.

  The analysis also depends on components from Nextstrain.
  Instructions for cloning them from GitHub are provided.
\item
  The code seems to be spread across the directories \texttt{jupyter\_notebooks}, \texttt{hyphy},
  \texttt{flu\_epidemiology}, and \texttt{src}, but it isn't clear what order the code should be run in,
  or how the components depend on each other.
\item
  The data itself is not archived, but links are provided
  in the \enquote{Install requirements} section of \texttt{README.md} to
  documents that describe how to obtain the data.
  Some intermediate data is also provided in the \texttt{data/} directory.

  The GitHub repo has a release with files \enquote{that are up-to-date with the version
  of the manuscript that was submitted to Virus Evolution on 31 January 2019.}

\hypertarget{ssh}{%
\chapter{Working Remotely}\label{ssh}}

When the Internet was young,
people didn't encrypt anything except the most sensitive information when sending it over a network.
However,
this meant that villains could steal usernames and passwords.
The \gref{SSH protocol}{ssh\_protocol}
was invented to prevent this (or at least slow it down).
It uses several sophisticated (and heavily tested) encryption protocols
to ensure that outsiders can't see what's in the messages
going back and forth between different computers.

To understand how it works,
let's take a closer look at what happens when we use the shell
on a desktop or laptop computer.
The first step is to log in
so that the operating system knows who we are and what we're allowed to do.
We do this by typing our username and password;
the operating system checks those values against its records,
and if they match,
runs a shell for us.

As we type commands,
characters are sent from our keyboard to the shell.
It displays those characters on the screen to represent what we type,
and then executes the command and displays its output (if any).
If we want to run commands on another machine,
such as the server in the basement that manages our database of experimental results,
we have to log in to that machine so that our commands will go to it instead of to our laptop.
We call this a \gref{remote login}{remote\_login}.

\hypertarget{ssh-login}{%
\section{Logging In}\label{ssh-login}}

In order for us to be able to login,
the remote computer must run a \gref{remote login server}{remote\_login\_server}
and we must run a program that can talk to that server.
The client program passes our login credentials to the remote login server;
if we are allowed to login,
that server then runs a shell for us on the remote computer (Figure~\ref{fig:ssh-ssh}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/ssh/ssh} 

}

\caption{The local client connects to the remote login server, which starts a remote shell (solid lines). Commands from the local client are passed to the remote shell and output is passed back (dashed lines).}\label{fig:ssh-ssh}
\end{figure}

Once our local client is connected to the remote server,
everything we type into the client is passed on, by the server, to the shell
running on the remote computer.
That remote shell runs those commands on our behalf,
just as a local shell would,
then sends back output, via the server, to our client, for our computer to display.

The remote login server which accepts connections from client programs
is known as the \gref{SSH daemon}{ssh\_daemon}, or \texttt{sshd}.
The client program we use to login remotely is the \gref{secure shell}{ssh\_glossary},
or \texttt{ssh}.
It has a companion program called \texttt{scp}
that allows us to copy files to or from a remote computer using the same kind of encrypted connection.

To make a remote login, we issue the command \texttt{ssh\ username@computer}
which tries to make a connection to the SSH daemon running on the remote computer we have specified.

After we log in,
we can use the remote shell to use the remote computer's files and directories.
Typing \texttt{exit} or Control-D
terminates the remote shell, and the local client program, and returns us to our previous shell.

In the example below,
the remote machine's command prompt is \texttt{moon\textgreater{}}
instead of \texttt{\$} to make it clearer which machine is doing what.

\hypertarget{ssh-cp}{%
\section{Copying Files}\label{ssh-cp}}

To copy a file,
we specify the source and destination paths,
either of which may include computer names.
If we leave out a computer name,
\texttt{scp} assumes we mean the machine we're running on.
For example,
this command copies our latest results to the backup server in the basement,
printing out its progress as it does so:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{scp}\NormalTok{ results.dat amira@backupserver:backups/results-2019-11-11.dat}
\ExtensionTok{Password}\NormalTok{: ********}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
results.dat              100%  9  1.0 MB/s 00:00
\end{verbatim}

Note the colon \texttt{:}, separating the hostname of the server and the pathname of
the file we are copying to.
It is this character that informs \texttt{scp} that the source or target of the copy is
on the remote machine and the reason it is needed can be explained as follows:

In the same way that the default directory into which we are placed when running
a shell on a remote machine is our home directory on that machine, the default
target, for a remote copy, is also the home directory.

This means that:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{scp}\NormalTok{ results.dat amira@backupserver:}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

would copy \texttt{results.dat} into our home directory on \texttt{backupserver}, however, if we did not
have the colon to inform \texttt{scp} of the remote machine, we would still have a valid command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{scp}\NormalTok{ results.dat amira@backupserver}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

but now we have merely created a file called \texttt{amira@backupserver} on our local machine,
as we would have done with \texttt{cp}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cp}\NormalTok{ results.dat amira@backupserver}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Copying a whole directory between remote machines uses the same syntax as the \texttt{cp} command:
we just use the \texttt{-r} option to signal that we want copying to be recursively.
For example,
this command copies all of our results from the backup server to our laptop:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{scp}\NormalTok{ -r amira@backupserver:backups ./backups}
\ExtensionTok{Password}\NormalTok{: ********}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
results-2019-09-18.dat              100%  7  1.0 MB/s 00:00
results-2019-10-04.dat              100%  9  1.0 MB/s 00:00
results-2019-10-28.dat              100%  8  1.0 MB/s 00:00
results-2019-11-11.dat              100%  9  1.0 MB/s 00:00
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{ssh-cmd}{%
\section{Running Commands}\label{ssh-cmd}}

Here's one more thing the \texttt{ssh} client program can do for us.
Suppose we want to check whether we have already created the file
\texttt{backups/results-2019-11-12.dat} on the backup server.
Instead of logging in and then typing \texttt{ls},
we could do this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ssh}\NormalTok{ amira@backupserver }\StringTok{"ls results*"}
\ExtensionTok{Password}\NormalTok{: ********}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
results-2019-09-18.dat  results-2019-10-28.dat
results-2019-10-04.dat  results-2019-11-11.dat
\end{verbatim}

Here, \texttt{ssh} takes the argument after our remote username
and passes them to the shell on the remote computer.
(We have to put quotes around it to make it look like a single argument.)
Since those arguments are a legal command,
the remote shell runs \texttt{ls\ results} for us
and sends the output back to our local shell for display.

\hypertarget{ssh-keys}{%
\section{Creating Keys}\label{ssh-keys}}

Typing our password over and over again is annoying,
especially if the commands we want to run remotely are in a loop.
To remove the need to do this,
we can create an \gref{SSH key}{ssh\_key}
to tell the remote machine
that it should always trust us.

SSH keys come in pairs, a public key that gets shared with services like GitHub,
and a private key that is stored only on our computer. If the keys match,
we are granted access.
The cryptography behind SSH keys ensures that no one can reverse engineer our
private key from the public one.

We might already have an SSH key pair on your machine.
We can check by moving to your \texttt{.ssh} directory and listing the contents.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\BuiltInTok{cd}\NormalTok{ ~/.ssh}
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ls}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If we see \texttt{id\_rsa.pub},
we already have a key pair and don't need to create a new one.

If we don't see \texttt{id\_rsa.pub},
this command will generate a new key pair.
(Make sure to replace \texttt{your@email.com} with your own email address.)

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ssh-keygen}\NormalTok{ -t rsa -C }\StringTok{"your@email.com"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When asked where to save the new key,
press enter to accept the default location.

\begin{verbatim}
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
\end{verbatim}

We will then be asked to provide an optional passphrase.
This can be used to make your key even more secure,
but if we want to avoid typing our password every time
we can skip it by pressing enter twice:

\begin{verbatim}
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
\end{verbatim}

When key generation is complete,
we should see the following confirmation:

\begin{verbatim}
Your identification has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your@email.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|                 |
|        . E +    |
|       . o = .   |
|      . S =   o  |
|       o.O . o   |
|       o .+ .    |
|      . o+..     |
|       .+=o      |
+-----------------+
\end{verbatim}

(The random art image is an alternate way to match keys.)
We now need to place a copy of our public key on
any servers we would like to to connect to.
Display the contents of our public key file with \texttt{cat}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{cat}\NormalTok{ ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

Copy the contents of the output,
then log in to the remote server as usual:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ssh}\NormalTok{ amira@moon.euphoric.edu}
\ExtensionTok{Password}\NormalTok{: ********}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Paste the copied content at the end of \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.ssh/authorized\_keys}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{moon}\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

After appending the content,
log out of the remote machine and try to log in again.
If we set up the SSH key correctly we won't need to type our password:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{moon}\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ exit}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ssh}\NormalTok{ amira@moon.euphoric.edu}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{ssh-filedir}{%
\section{Dependencies}\label{ssh-filedir}}

The example of copying our public key to a remote machine, so that it
can then be used when we next SSH into that remote machine, assumed
that we already had a directory \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.ssh/}.

Whilst a remote server may support the use of SSH to login, your home
directory there may not contain a \texttt{.ssh} directory by default.

We have already seen that we can use SSH to run commands on remote
machines, so we can ensure that everything is set up as required before
we place the copy of our public key on a remote machine.

Walking through this process allows us to highlight some of the typical
requirements of the SSH protocol itself, as documented in the man-page
for the \texttt{ssh} command.

Firstly, we check that we have a \texttt{.ssh/} directory on another remote
machine, \texttt{comet}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ssh}\NormalTok{ amira@comet }\StringTok{"ls -ld ~/.ssh"}
\ExtensionTok{Password}\NormalTok{: ********}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
ls: cannot access /Users/amira/.ssh: No such file or directory
\end{verbatim}

Oops:
we should create the directory and check that it's there:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ssh}\NormalTok{ amira@comet }\StringTok{"mkdir ~/.ssh"}
\ExtensionTok{Password}\NormalTok{: ********}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ssh}\NormalTok{ amira@comet }\StringTok{"ls -ld ~/.ssh"}
\ExtensionTok{Password}\NormalTok{: ********}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
drwxr-xr-x 2 amira amira 512 Jan 01 09:09 /Users/amira/.ssh
\end{verbatim}

Now we have a \texttt{.ssh} directory, into which to place SSH-related
files, but we can see that the default permissions allow anyone to
inspect the files within that directory.

For a protocol that is supposed to be secure, this is not considered
a good thing and so the recommended permissions are read/write/execute
for the user, and not accessible by others.

Let's alter the permissions on the directory:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ssh}\NormalTok{ amira@comet }\StringTok{"chmod 700 ~/.ssh; ls -ld ~/.ssh"}
\ExtensionTok{Password}\NormalTok{: ********}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
drwx------ 2 amira amira 512 Jan 01 09:09 /Users/amira/.ssh
\end{verbatim}

That looks much better.

In the above example, it was suggested that we paste the content of
our public key at the end of \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.ssh/authorized\_keys}, however as
we didn't have a \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.ssh/} on this remote machine, we can simply
copy our public key over as the initial \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.ssh/authorized\_keys},
and of course, we will use \texttt{scp} to do this, even though we don't
yet have passwordless SSH access set up.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{scp}\NormalTok{ ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub amira@comet:.ssh/authorized_keys}
\ExtensionTok{Password}\NormalTok{: ********}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that the default target for the \texttt{scp} command on a remote
machine is the home directory, so we have not needed to use the
shorthand \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.ssh/} or even the full path \texttt{/Users/amira/.ssh/} to
our home directory there.

Checking the permissions of the file we have just created on
the remote machine, also serves to indicate that we no longer
need to use our password, because we now have what's needed
to use SSH without it.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ssh}\NormalTok{ amira@comet }\StringTok{"ls -l ~/.ssh"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
-rw-r--r-- 2 amira amira 512 Jan 01 09:11 /Users/amira/.ssh/authorized_keys
\end{verbatim}

Whilst the authorized keys file is not considered to be highly sensitive,
(after all, it contains public keys), we alter the permissions to match
the man page's recommendations

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\FunctionTok{ssh}\NormalTok{ amira@comet }\StringTok{"chmod go-r ~/.ssh/authorized_keys; ls -l ~/.ssh"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
-rw------- 2 amira amira 512 Jan 01 09:11 /Users/amira/.ssh/authorized_keys
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{style}{%
\chapter{Writing Readable Code}\label{style}}

Nothing in biology makes sense except in light of evolution (Dobzhansky \protect\hyperlink{ref-Dobz1973}{1973}).
Similarly,
nothing in software development makes sense except in light of human psychology.
This is particularly true when we look at programming style.
Computers don't need to understand programs in order to execute them,
but people do if they are to create, debug, and extend them.

Throughout this book we have written code to analyze word counts in classic novels
using good Python style.
This appendix discusses the style choices we made,
presents guidelines for good Python programming style,\index{Python!style}
and introduces some language features that can make programs more flexible and more readable.

\hypertarget{style-pep8}{%
\section{Python Style}\label{style-pep8}}

The single most important rule of style is to be consistent,
both internally and with other programs (Kernighan and Pike \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kern1999}{1999}).
Python's standard style is called \href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/}{PEP-8};\index{Python!PEP-8}\index{PEP-8 (Python style)}
the acronym \enquote{PEP} is short for \enquote{Python Enhancement Proposal},
and PEP-8 lays out the rules that Python's own libraries use.
Some of its rules are listed below,
along with others borrowed from \enquote{\href{https://github.com/jennybc/code-smells-and-feels}{Code Smells and Feels}}:

\hypertarget{spacing}{%
\subsection{Spacing}\label{spacing}}

\textbf{Always indent code blocks using 4 spaces, and use spaces instead of tabs.}

Python doesn't actually require consistent indentation
so long as each block is indented the same amount,
which means that this is legal:\index{whitespace}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ transpose(original):}
\NormalTok{  result }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ Matrix(original.numRow, original.numCol)}
  \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ row }\KeywordTok{in} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(original.numRow):}
              \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ col }\KeywordTok{in} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(original.numCol):}
\NormalTok{               result[row, col] }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ original[col, row]}
  \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ result}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The same block of code is much more readable when written as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ transpose(original):}
\NormalTok{    result }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ Matrix(original.numRow, original.numCol)}
    \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ row }\KeywordTok{in} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(original.numRow):}
        \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ col }\KeywordTok{in} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(original.numCol):}
\NormalTok{            result[row, col] }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ original[col, row]}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ result}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The use of 4 spaces is a compromise between 2
(which we find perfectly readable, but some people find too crowded)
and 8
(which most people agree uses up too much horizontal space).
As for the use of spaces rather than tabs,
the original reason was that the most common interpretation of tabs
by the editors of the 1980s was 8 spaces,
which again was more than most people felt necessary.
Today,
almost all editors will auto-indent or auto-complete when the tab key is pressed
(or insert spaces, if configured to do so),
but the legacy of those ancient times lives on.

\textbf{Do not put spaces inside parentheses.}

Write \texttt{(1+2)} instead of \texttt{(~1+2~)}.
This applies to function calls as well:
write \texttt{max(a,\ b)} rather than \texttt{max(~a,~b~)}.
(We will see a related rule when we discussed default parameter values
in Section~\ref{style-features}.)

\textbf{Always use spaces around comparisons like \texttt{\textgreater{}} and \texttt{\textless{}=}.}

Python automatically interprets \texttt{a+b\textless{}c+d} as \texttt{(a+b)\textless{}(c+d)},
but that's a lot of punctuation crowded together.
Using spaces around comparison operators makes it easier to see
what's being compared to what.
However,
we should use our own judgment for spacing around arithmetic operators like \texttt{+} and \texttt{/}.
For example,
\texttt{a+b+c} is perfectly readable,
but

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{substrate[i, j] }\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{ overlay[i, j]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

is easier for the eye to follow than the spaceless:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{substrate[i, j]}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{overlay[i, j]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Most programmers would also write:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{a}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{b }\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{ c}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{d}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

instead of:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{a}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{b}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{c}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{d}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(a}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{b)}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{(c}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{d)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Adding spaces makes simple expressions more readable,
but does not change the way Python interprets them---when it encounters \texttt{a~*~b+c},
for example,
Python still does the multiplication before the addition.

\textbf{Put two blank lines between each function definition.}

This helps the eye see where one ends and the next begins,
though the fact that functions always start in the first column helps as well.

\textbf{Add an empty line at the end of the script.}

Ending a file in a newline character is required for some other programming languages.
Although it's not required for Python code to function,
it does make it easier to view and edit code.\index{whitespace}

\hypertarget{naming}{%
\subsection{Naming}\label{naming}}

\textbf{Use \texttt{ALL\_CAPS\_WITH\_UNDERSCORES} for global variables.}

This convention is inherited from C,\index{Python!style!variable naming}
which was used to write the first version of Python.
In that language,
upper case was used to indicate a constant whose value couldn't be modified;
Python doesn't enforce that rule,
but \texttt{SHOUTING\_AT\_PROGRAMMERS} helps remind them that
some things shouldn't be messed with.

\textbf{Use \texttt{lower\_case\_with\_underscores} for the names of functions and variables.}

Research on naming conventions has produced mixed results (Binkley et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bink2012}{2012}; Schankin et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Scha2018}{2018})
but Python has (mostly) settled on underscored names for most things.
This style is called \gref{snake case}{snake\_case} or \gref{pothole case}{pothole\_case};
we should only use \gref{CamelCase}{camel\_case} for classes,
which are outside the scope of this lesson.

\textbf{Avoid abbreviations in function and variable names.}

Abbreviations and acronyms can be ambiguous
(does \texttt{xcl} mean \enquote{Excel}, \enquote{exclude}, or \enquote{excellent}?),
and can be be hard for non-native speakers to understand.
Following this rule doesn't necessarily require more typing:
a good programming editor will \gref{auto-complete}{auto\_completion} names for us.

\textbf{Use short names for short-lived local variables and longer names for things with wider scope.}

Using \texttt{i} and \texttt{j} for loop indices is perfectly readable
provided the loop is only a few lines long (Beniamini et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Beni2017}{2017}).
Anything that is used at a greater distance
or whose purpose isn't immediately clear
(such as a function) should have a longer name.

\textbf{Do not comment and uncomment sections of code to change behavior.}

If we need to do something in some runs of the program and not in others,
use an \texttt{if} statement to enable or disable that block of code:
it eliminates the risk of accidentally commenting out one too many lines.
If the lines we were removing or commenting out print debugging information,
we should replace them with logging calls (Section~\ref{errors-logging}).
If they are operations that we want to execute,
we can add a configuration option (Chapter~\ref{config}),
and if we are sure we don't need the code,
we should take it out completely:
we can always get it back from version control
(Section~\ref{git-cmdline-ex-recover}).

\hypertarget{style-order}{%
\section{Order}\label{style-order}}

The order of items in each file should be:\index{Python!style!order in file}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \gref{shebang}{shebang} line (because it has to be first to work).\index{shebang (in shell script)}
\item
  The file's documentation string (Section~\ref{scripting-docstrings}).
\item
  All of the \texttt{import} statements, one per line.
\item
  Global variable definitions
  (especially things that would be constants in languages that support them).
\item
  Function definitions.
\item
  If the file can be run as a program,
  the \texttt{if\ \_\_name\_\_\ ==\ \textquotesingle{}\_\_main\_\_\textquotesingle{}} statement discussed in
  Section~\ref{scripting-main}.
\end{itemize}

That much is clear,
but programmers disagree (strongly) on whether high-level functions should come first or last,
i.e.,
whether \texttt{main} should be the first function in the file or the last one.
Our scripts put it last,
so that it is immediately before the check on \texttt{\_\_name\_\_}.
Wherever it goes,
\texttt{main} tends to follow one of three patterns:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Figure out what the user has asked it to do (Chapter~\ref{config}).
\item
  Read all input data.
\item
  Process it.
\item
  Write output.
\end{enumerate}

or:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Figure out what the user has asked for.
\item
  For each input file:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Read.
  \item
    Process.
  \item
    Write file-specific output (if any).
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Write summary output (if any).
\end{enumerate}

or:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Figure out what the user has asked for.
\item
  Repeatedly:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Wait for user input.
  \item
    Do what the user has asked.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Exit when a \enquote{stop} command of some sort is received.
\end{enumerate}

Each step in each of the outlines above usually becomes a function.
Those functions depend on others,
some of which are written to break code into comprehensible chunks and are then called just once,
others of which are utilities that may be called many times from many different places.

We put all of the single-use functions in the first half of the file
in the order in which they are likely to be called,
and then put all of the multi-use utility functions in the bottom of the file in alphabetical order.
If any of those utility functions are used by other scripts or programs,
they should go in a file of their own (Section~\ref{scripting-modules}).

In fact,
this is a good practice even if those functions are only used by one program,
since it signals even more clearly which are specific to this program
and which are likely to be reused elsewhere.
This is why we create \texttt{collate.py} in Section~\ref{scripting-collate}:
we could have kept all of our code in \texttt{countwords.py},
but collating felt like something we might want to do separately.

\hypertarget{style-check}{%
\section{Checking Style}\label{style-check}}

Checking that code conforms to guidelines like PEP-8 would be time consuming
if we had to do it manually,
but most languages have tools that will check style rules for us.
These tools are often called \gref{linters}{linter},\index{lint (style checking tool)}\index{Python!style!checking}
after an early tool called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)}{\texttt{lint}} that found lint (or fluff) in C code.

Python's linter used to be called \texttt{pep8} and is now called \texttt{pycodestyle}.
To see how it works,
let's look at this program,
which is supposed to count the number of \gref{stop words}{stop\_word} in a document:

\hypertarget{style-refactor}{%
\section{Refactoring}\label{style-refactor}}

Once a program gets a clean bill of health from \texttt{pycodestyle},
it's worth having a human being look it over and suggest improvements.
To \gref{refactor}{refactoring} code\index{refactoring (software)}
means to change its structure without changing what it does,
like simplifying an equation.
It is just as much a part of programming as writing code in the first place:
nobody gets things right the first time (Brand \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bran1995}{1995}),
and needs or insights can change over time.

Most discussions of refactoring focus on \gref{object-oriented programming}{oop},
but many patterns can and should be used to clean up \gref{procedural}{procedural\_programming} code.
Knowing a few of these patterns helps us create better software
and makes it easier to communicate with our peers.

\hypertarget{do-not-repeat-values}{%
\subsection{Do not repeat values}\label{do-not-repeat-values}}

The first and simplest refactoring is \enquote{replace value with name}.
It tells us to replace magic numbers with names,
i.e., to define constants.
This can seem ridiculous in simple cases
(why define and use \texttt{inches\_per\_foot} instead of just writing 12?).
However,
what may be obvious to us when we're writing code won't be obvious to the next person,
particularly if they are working in a different context
(most of the world uses the metric system and doesn't know how many inches are in a foot).
It is also a matter of habit:
if we write numbers without explanation in our code for simple cases,
we are more likely to do so in complex cases,
and more likely to regret it afterward.

Using names instead of raw values also makes it easier to understand code when we read it aloud,
which is always a good test of its style.
Finally,
a single value defined in one place is much easier to change
than a bunch of numbers scattered throughout our program.
We may not think we will have to change it,
but then people want to use our software on Mars and we discover that constants aren't (Mak \protect\hyperlink{ref-Mak2006}{2006}).

\hypertarget{do-not-repeat-calculations-in-loops}{%
\subsection{Do not repeat calculations in loops}\label{do-not-repeat-calculations-in-loops}}

It's inefficient to calculate the same value over and over again.
It also makes code less readable:
if a calculation is inside a loop or a function,
readers will assume that it might change each time the code is executed.

Our second refactoring,
\enquote{hoist repeated calculation out of loop},
tells us to move the repeated calculation out of the loop or function.
Doing this signals that its value is always the same.
And naming that common value helps readers understand what its purpose is.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{replace-tests-with-flags-to-clarify-repeated-tests}{%
\subsection{Replace tests with flags to clarify repeated tests}\label{replace-tests-with-flags-to-clarify-repeated-tests}}

Novice programmers frequently write conditional tests like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (a }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ b) }\OperatorTok{==} \VariableTok{True}\NormalTok{:}
    \CommentTok{# ...do something...}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The comparison to \texttt{True} is unnecessary because \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b} is a Boolean value
that is itself either \texttt{True} or \texttt{False}.
Like any other value,
Booleans can be assigned to variables,
and those variables can then be used directly in tests:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{was_greater }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ estimate }\OperatorTok{>} \FloatTok{0.0}
\CommentTok{# ...other code that might change estimate...}
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ was_greater:}
    \CommentTok{# ...do something...}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This refactoring is \enquote{replace repeated test with flag}.
Again,
there is no need to write \texttt{if\ was\_greater\ ==\ True}:
that always produces the same result as \texttt{if\ was\_greater}.
Similarly,
the equality tests in \texttt{if\ was\_greater\ ==\ False} is redundant:
the expression can simply be written \texttt{if\ not\ was\_greater}.
Creating and using a \gref{flag}{flag\_variable} instead of repeating the test
is therefore like moving a calculation out of a loop:
even if that value is only used once,
it makes our intention clearer.

    \CommentTok{# ...process data to create score...}
    \ControlFlowTok{if} \BuiltInTok{len}\NormalTok{(data) }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ THRESHOLD:}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\NormalTok{        score }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ score }\OperatorTok{**} \DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If it takes many lines of code to process data and create a score,
and the test then needs to change from \texttt{\textgreater{}} to \texttt{\textgreater{}=},
we are more likely to get the refactored version right the first time,
since the test only appears in one place and its result is given a name.

\hypertarget{use-in-place-operators-to-avoid-duplicating-expression}{%
\subsection{Use in-place operators to avoid duplicating expression}\label{use-in-place-operators-to-avoid-duplicating-expression}}

An \gref{in-place operator}{in\_place\_operator},
sometimes called an \gref{update operator}{update\_operator},
does a calculation with two values
and overwrites one of the values.
For example,
instead of writing:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{step }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ step }\OperatorTok{+} \DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

we can write:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{step }\OperatorTok{+=} \DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In-place operators save us some typing.
They also make the intention clearer,
and most importantly,
they make it harder to get complex assignments wrong.
For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{samples[least_factor_index,}
        \BuiltInTok{max}\NormalTok{(current_offset, offset_limit)] }\OperatorTok{*=}\NormalTok{ scaling_factor}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

is less difficult to read than the equivalent expression:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{samples[least_factor_index, }\BuiltInTok{max}\NormalTok{(current_offset, offset_limit)] }\OperatorTok{=} \OperatorTok{\textbackslash{}}
\NormalTok{    scaling_factor }\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{ samples[least_factor_index,}
                             \BuiltInTok{max}\NormalTok{(current_limit, offset_limit)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

(The proof of this claim is that you probably didn't notice
that the long form uses different expressions to index \texttt{samples}
on the left and right of the assignment.)
The refactoring \enquote{use in-place operator} does what its name suggests:
converts normal assignments into their briefer equivalents.

\hypertarget{handle-special-cases-first}{%
\subsection{Handle special cases first}\label{handle-special-cases-first}}

A \gref{short circuit test}{short\_circuit\_test} is a quick check to handle a special case,
such as checking the length of a list of values
and returning \texttt{math.nan} for the average if the list is empty.
\enquote{Place short circuits early} tells us to put short-circuit tests near the start of functions
so that readers can mentally remove special cases from their thinking
while reading the code that handles the usual case.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Return consistently}

PEP-8 says, \enquote{Be consistent in \texttt{return} statements,}
and goes on to say that either all \texttt{return} statements in a function should return a value,
or none of them should.
If a function contains any explicit \texttt{return} statements at all,
it should end with one as well.
\end{quote}

A related refactoring pattern is \enquote{default and override}.
To use it,
assign a default or most common value to a variable unconditionally,
and then override it in a special case.
The result is fewer lines of code and clearer control flow;
however,
it does mean executing two assignments instead of one,
so it shouldn't be used if the common case is expensive
(e.g., involves a database lookup or a web request).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# ...before..}

\NormalTok{    scale }\OperatorTok{=} \FloatTok{0.8}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In simple cases,
people will sometimes put the test and assignment on a single line:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{scale }\OperatorTok{=} \FloatTok{1.0}
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ configuration[}\StringTok{'threshold'}\NormalTok{] }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ UPPER_BOUND: scale }\OperatorTok{=} \FloatTok{0.8}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Some programmers take this even further
and use a \gref{conditional expression}{conditional\_expression}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{scale }\OperatorTok{=} \FloatTok{0.8} \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ configuration[}\StringTok{'threshold'}\NormalTok{] }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ UPPER_BOUND }\ControlFlowTok{else} \FloatTok{1.0}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However,
this puts the default last instead of first,
which is less clear.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{A Little Jargon}

\texttt{X\ if\ test\ else\ Y} is called a \gref{ternary expression}{ternary\_expression}.

a ternary expression has three.
Conditional expressions are the only ternary expression in most programming languages.

\hypertarget{use-functions-to-make-code-more-comprehensible}{%
\subsection{Use functions to make code more comprehensible}\label{use-functions-to-make-code-more-comprehensible}}

Functions were created so that programmers could re-use common operations,
but moving code into functions also reduces \gref{cognitive load}{cognitive\_load}
by reducing the number of things that have to be understood simultaneously.

A common rule of thumb is that
no function should be longer than a printed page (about 80 lines)
or have more than four levels of indentation because of nested loops and conditionals.
Anything longer or more deeply nested is hard for readers to understand,
so we should moves pieces of long functions into small ones.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We should \emph{always} extract functions when code can be re-used.
Even if they are only used once,
multi-part conditionals,
long equations,
and the bodies of loops are good candidates for extraction.
If we can't think of a plausible name,
or if a lot of data has to be passed into the function after it's extracted,
the code should probably be left where it is.
Finally,
it's often helpful to keep using the original variable names as parameter names during refactoring
to reduce typing.

\hypertarget{combine-operations-in-functions}{%
\subsection{Combine operations in functions}\label{combine-operations-in-functions}}

\enquote{Combine functions} is the opposite of \enquote{extract function}.
If operations are always done together,
it can sometimes be be more efficient to do them together,
and might be easier to understand.
However,
combining functions often reduces their reusability and readability.
(One sign that functions shouldn't have been combined is
people using the combination and throwing some of the result away.)

The fragment below shows how two functions can be combined:

The more cases there are,
the greater the advantage lookup tables have over multi-part conditionals.
Those advantages multiply when items can belong to more than one category,
in which case the table is often best written as a dictionary with items as keys
and sets of categories as values:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{LETTERS }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ \{}
    \StringTok{'A'}\NormalTok{ : \{}\StringTok{'vowel'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'upper_case'}\NormalTok{\},}

\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ count_vowels_and_consonants(text):}
\NormalTok{    num_vowels }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ num_consonants }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{0}
    \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ char }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ text:}
\NormalTok{        num_vowels }\OperatorTok{+=} \BuiltInTok{int}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'vowel'} \KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ LETTERS[char])}
\NormalTok{        num_consonants }\OperatorTok{+=} \BuiltInTok{int}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'consonant'} \KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ LETTERS[char])}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ num_vowels, num_consonants}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The expressions used to update \texttt{num\_vowels} and \texttt{num\_consonants} make use of the fact that
\texttt{in} produces either \texttt{True} or \texttt{False},
which the function \texttt{int} converts to either 1 or 0.
We will explore ways of making this code more readable in the exercises.

\hypertarget{style-review}{%
\section{Code Reviews}\label{style-review}}

At the end of Section~\ref{style-check},
our stop-word program looked like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ sys}


\NormalTok{stops }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [}\StringTok{'a'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'A'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'the'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'The'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'and'}\NormalTok{]}


\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ count(ln):}
\NormalTok{    n }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{0}
    \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ i }\KeywordTok{in} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(}\BuiltInTok{len}\NormalTok{(ln)):}
\NormalTok{        line }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ ln[i]}
\NormalTok{        stuff }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ line.split()}
        \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ word }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ stuff:}
            \CommentTok{# print(word)}
\NormalTok{            j }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ stops.count(word)}
            \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ j }\OperatorTok{>} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{                n }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ n }\OperatorTok{+} \DecValTok{1}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ n}


\NormalTok{lines }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ sys.stdin.readlines()}
\CommentTok{# print('number of lines', len(lines))}
\NormalTok{n }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ count(lines)}
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'number'}\NormalTok{, n)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This passes a PEP-8 style check,
but based on our coding guidelines and our discussion of refactoring,
these things should be changed:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The commented-out \texttt{print} statements should either be removed
  or turned into logging statements (Section~\ref{errors-logging}).
\item
  The variables \texttt{ln}, \texttt{i}, and \texttt{j} should be given clearer names.
\item
  The outer loop in \texttt{count} loops over the indices of the line list
  rather than over the lines.
  It should do the latter
  (which will allow us to get rid of the variable \texttt{i}).
\item
  Rather than counting how often a word occurs in the list of stop words with \texttt{stops.count},
  we can turn the stop words into a set and use \texttt{in} to check words.
  This will be more readable \emph{and} more efficient.
\item
  There's no reason to store the result of \texttt{line.split} in a temporary variable:
  the inner loop of \texttt{count} can use it directly.
\item
  Since the set of stop words is a global variable,
  it should be written in upper case.
\item
  We should use \texttt{+=} to increment the counter \texttt{n}.
\item
  Rather than reading the input into a list of lines and then looping over that,
  we can give \texttt{count} a stream and have it process the lines one by one.
\item
  Since we might want to use \texttt{count} in other programs some day,
  we should put the two lines at the bottom that handle input into a conditional
  so that they aren't executed when this script is imported.
\end{itemize}

After making all these changes,
our program looks like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ sys}


\NormalTok{STOPS }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ \{}\StringTok{'a'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'A'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'the'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'The'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'and'}\NormalTok{\}}


\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ count(reader):}
\NormalTok{    n }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{0}
    \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ line }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ reader:}
        \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ word }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ line.split():}
            \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ word }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ STOPS:}
\NormalTok{                n }\OperatorTok{+=} \DecValTok{1}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ n}

    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'number'}\NormalTok{, n)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Reading code in order to find bugs and suggest improvements like these
is called \gref{code review}{code\_review}.\index{code review}
Multiple studies over more than 40 years have shown that
code review is the most effective way to find bugs in software
(Fagan \protect\hyperlink{ref-Faga1976}{1976}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Faga1986}{1986}; Cohen \protect\hyperlink{ref-Cohe2010}{2010}; Bacchelli and Bird \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bacc2013}{2013}).
It is also a great way to transfer knowledge between programmers:
reading someone else's code critically will give us lots of ideas about what we could do better,
and highlight things that we should probably stop doing as well.

Despite this,
code review still isn't common in research software development.
This is partly a chicken-and-egg problem:
people don't do it because other people don't do it (Segal \protect\hyperlink{ref-Sega2005}{2005}).
Code review is also more difficult to do in specialized scientific fields:
in order for review to be useful,
reviewers need to understand the problem domain well enough to comment on algorithms and design choices
rather than indentation and variable naming,
and the number of people who can do that for a research project is often very small (Petre and Wilson \protect\hyperlink{ref-Petr2014}{2014}).

Section~\ref{git-advanced-pull-requests} explained how to create and merge pull requests.
How we review these is just as important as what we look for:
being dismissive or combative are good ways to ensure that people don't pay attention to our reviews,
or avoid having us review their work (Bernhardt \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bern2018}{2018}).
Equally,
being defensive when someone offers suggestions politely and sincerely is very human,
but can stunt our development as a programmer.

Lots of people have written guidelines for doing reviews that avoid these traps (Quenneville \protect\hyperlink{ref-Quen2018}{2018}; Sankarram \protect\hyperlink{ref-Sank2018}{2018}).
A few common points are:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Work in small increments.]
As Cohen (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Cohe2010}{2010}) and others have found,
code review is most effective when done in short bursts.
That means that change requests should also be short:
anything that's more than a couple of screens long
should be broken into smaller pieces.
\item[Look for algorithmic problems first.]
Code review isn't just (or even primarily) about style:
its real purpose is to find bugs before they can affect anyone.
The first pass over any change should therefore look for algorithmic problems.
Are the calculations right?
Are any rare cases going to be missed?
Are errors being caught and handled (Chapter~\ref{errors})?
Using a consistent style helps reviewers focus on these issues.
\item[Use a checklist.]
Linters are great,
but can't decide when someone should have used a lookup table instead of conditionals.
A list of things to check for can make review faster and more comprehensible,
especially when we can copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop specific comments
onto specific lines
(something that GitHub unfortunately doesn't yet support).
\item[Ask for clarification.]
If we don't understand something,
or don't understand why the author did it,
we should ask.
(When the author explains it,
we might suggest that the explanation should be documented somewhere.)
\item[Offer alternatives.]
Telling authors that something is wrong is helpful;
telling them what they might do instead is more so.
\item[Don't be sarcastic or disparaging.]
\enquote{Did you maybe think about \emph{testing} this garbage?}
is a Code of Conduct violation in any well-run project.
\item[Don't present opinions as facts.]
\enquote{Nobody uses X any more} might be true.
If it is,
the person making the claim ought to be able to point at download statistics
or a Google Trends search;
if they can't,
they should say,
\enquote{I don't think we use X any more} and explain why they think that.
\item[Don't feign surprise or pass judgment.]
\enquote{Gosh, didn't you know {[}some obscure fact{]}?} isn't helpful;
neither is, \enquote{Geez, why don't you {[}some clever trick{]} here?}
\item[Don't overwhelm people with details.]
If someone has used the letter \texttt{x} as a variable name in several places,
and they shouldn't have,
comment on the first two or three and simply put a check beside the others---the reader
won't need the comment repeated.
\item[Don't try to sneak in feature requests.]
Nobody enjoys fixing bugs and style violations.
Asking them to add entirely new functionality while they're at it is rude.
\end{description}

How we respond to reviews is just as important:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Be specific in replies to reviewers.]
If someone has suggested a better variable name,
we can probably simply fix it.
If someone has suggested a major overhaul to an algorithm,
we should reply to their comment to point at the commit that includes the fix.
\item[Thank our reviewers.]
If someone has taken the time to read our code carefully,
thank them for doing it.
\end{description}

And finally:

\textbf{Don't let anyone break these rules just because they're frequent contributors or in positions of power.}
The culture of any organization is shaped by the worst behavior it is willing to tolerate Gruenert and Whitaker (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Grue2015}{2015}).
The main figures in a project should be \emph{more} respectful than everyone else
in order to show what standards everyone else is expected to meet.

\hypertarget{style-features}{%
\section{Python Features}\label{style-features}}

\gref{Working memory}{working\_memory} can only hold a few items at once:
initial estimates in the 1950s put the number at 7±2 (Miller \protect\hyperlink{ref-Mill1956}{1956}),
and more recent estimates put it as low as 4 or 5.
High-level languages from FORTRAN to Python
are essentially a way to reduce the number of things programmers have to think about at once
so that they can fit what the computer is doing into this limited space.
The sections below describe some of these features;
as we become more comfortable with Python we will find and use others.

But beware:
the things that make programs more compact and comprehensible for experienced programmers
can make them less comprehensible for novices.
For example,
suppose we want to create this matrix as a list of lists:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{[[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{],}
\NormalTok{ [}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{],}
\NormalTok{ [}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{],}
\NormalTok{ [}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{],}
\NormalTok{ [}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{]]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

One way is to use loops:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{matrix }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ []}
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ i }\KeywordTok{in} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{):}
\NormalTok{    row }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ []}
    \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ j }\KeywordTok{in} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{):}
\NormalTok{        row.append(i}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{j)}
\NormalTok{    matrix.append(row)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Another is to use a nested \gref{list comprehension}{list\_comprehension}:\index{list comprehension (in Python)}\index{Python!list comprehension}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{[[i}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{j }\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ j }\KeywordTok{in} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)] }\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ i }\KeywordTok{in} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

An experienced programmer might recognize what the latter is doing;
the rest of us are probably better off reading and writing the more verbose solution.

\hypertarget{provide-default-values-for-parameters}{%
\subsection{Provide default values for parameters}\label{provide-default-values-for-parameters}}

If our function requires two dozen parameters,
the odds are very good that users will frequently forget them
or put them in the wrong order.
One solution is to bundle parameters together so that (for example)
people pass three \texttt{point} objects instead of nine separate \texttt{x}, \texttt{y}, and \texttt{z} values.

A second approach (which can be combined with the previous one)
is to specify \gref{default values}{default\_value} for some of the parameters.\index{default value (for parameter)}\index{Python!default values for parameters}
Doing this gives users control over everything
while also allowing them to ignore details;
it also indicates what we consider \enquote{normal} for the function.

For example,
suppose we are comparing images to see if they are the same or different.
We can specify two kinds of tolerance:
how large a difference in color value to notice,
and how many differences above that threshold to tolerate
as a percentage of the total number of pixels.
By default,
any color difference is considered significant,
and only 1\% of pixels are allowed to differ:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ image_diff(left, right, per_pixel}\OperatorTok{=}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, fraction}\OperatorTok{=}\FloatTok{0.01}\NormalTok{):}
    \CommentTok{# ...implementation...}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When this function is called using \texttt{image\_diff(old,\ new)},
those default values apply.
However,
it can also be called like this:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{image\_diff(old,\ new,\ per\_pixel=2)}
  allows pixels to differ slightly without those differences being significant.
\item
  \texttt{image\_diff(old,\ new,\ fraction=0.05)} allows more pixels to differ.
\item
  \texttt{image\_diff(old,\ new,\ per\_pixel=1,\ fraction=0.005)}
  raises the per-pixel threshold but decrease number of allowed differences.
\end{itemize}

Note that we do not put spaces around the \texttt{=} when defining a default parameter value.
This is consistent with PEP-8's rules about spacing in function definitions and calls
(Section~\ref{style-pep8}).

Default parameter values make code easier to understand and use,
but there is a subtle trap.
When Python executes a function definition like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ collect(new_value, accumulator}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{set}\NormalTok{()):}
\NormalTok{    accumulator.add(new_value)}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ accumulator}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

it calls \texttt{set()} to create a new empty set
\emph{when it is reading the function definition},
and then uses that set as the default value for \texttt{accumulator}
every time the function is called.
It does \emph{not} call \texttt{set()} once for each call,
so all calls using the default will share the same set:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OperatorTok{>>>}\NormalTok{ collect(}\StringTok{'first'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\{}\StringTok{'first'}\NormalTok{\}}
\OperatorTok{>>>}\NormalTok{ collect(}\StringTok{'second'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\{}\StringTok{'first'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'second'}\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

A common way to avoid this is to pass \texttt{None} to the function
to signal that the user didn't provide a value:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ collect(new_value, accumulator}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{None}\NormalTok{):}
    \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ accumulator }\KeywordTok{is} \VariableTok{None}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{        accumulator }\OperatorTok{=} \BuiltInTok{set}\NormalTok{()}
\NormalTok{    accumulator.add(new_value)}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ accumulator}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{handle-a-variable-number-of-arguments}{%
\subsection{Handle a variable number of arguments}\label{handle-a-variable-number-of-arguments}}

We can often make programs simpler by writing functions that take
\gref{a variable number of arguments}{variable\_arguments},\index{Python!variable arguments}
just like \texttt{print} and \texttt{max}.
One way to to require user to stuff those arguments into a list,
e.g.,
to write \texttt{find\_limits({[}a,\ b,\ c,\ d{]})}.
However,
Python can do this for us.
If we declare a single argument whose name starts with a single \texttt{*},
Python will put all \enquote{extra} arguments into a \gref{tuple}{tuple}\index{tuple (in Python)}\index{Python!tuple}
and pass that as the argument.
By convention,
this argument is called \texttt{args}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ find_limits(}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{args):}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(args)}

\NormalTok{find_limits(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
(1, 3, 5, 2, 4)
\end{verbatim}

This catch-all parameter can be used with regular parameters,
but must come last in the parameter list to avoid ambiguity:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ select_outside(low, high, }\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{values):}
\NormalTok{    result }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ []}
    \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ v }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ values:}
        \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ (v }\OperatorTok{<}\NormalTok{ low) }\KeywordTok{or}\NormalTok{ (v }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ high):}
\NormalTok{            result.add(v)}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ result}

\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(select_outside(}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{1.0}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.3}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{-0.2}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{-0.5}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.4}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{1.7}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[-0.2, -0.5, 1.7]
\end{verbatim}

An equivalent special form exists for \gref{keyword arguments}{keyword\_arguments}:
the catch-all variable's name is prefixed with \texttt{**} (i.e., two asterisks instead of one),
and it is conventionally called \texttt{kwargs} (for \enquote{keyword arguments}).\index{Python!keyword arguments}\index{keyword arguments (in Python)}
When this is used,
the function is given a \gref{dictionary}{dictionary} of names and values
rather than a list:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ set_options(tag, }\OperatorTok{**}\NormalTok{kwargs):}
\NormalTok{    result }\OperatorTok{=} \SpecialStringTok{f'<}\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{tag}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{'}
    \ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ key }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ kwargs:}
\NormalTok{        result }\OperatorTok{+=} \SpecialStringTok{f' }\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{key}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{="}\SpecialCharTok{\{}\NormalTok{kwargs[key]}\SpecialCharTok{\}}\SpecialStringTok{"'}
\NormalTok{    result }\OperatorTok{+=} \StringTok{'/>'}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ result}

\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(set_options(}\StringTok{'h1'}\NormalTok{, color}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'blue'}\NormalTok{))}
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(set_options(}\StringTok{'p'}\NormalTok{, align}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'center'}\NormalTok{, size}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'150%'}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
<h1 color="blue"/>
<p align="center" size="150%"/>
\end{verbatim}

Notice that the names of parameters are not quoted:
we pass \texttt{color=\textquotesingle{}blue\textquotesingle{}} to the function,
not \texttt{\textquotesingle{}color\textquotesingle{}=\textquotesingle{}blue\textquotesingle{}}.

\hypertarget{unpacking-variable-arguments}{%
\subsection{Unpacking variable arguments}\label{unpacking-variable-arguments}}

We can use the inverse of \texttt{*args} and \texttt{**kwargs} to match a list of values to arguments.
In this case,
we put the \texttt{*} in front of a list and \texttt{**} in front of a dictionary when \emph{calling} the function,
rather than in front of the parameter when \emph{defining} it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ trim_value(data, low, high):}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(data, }\StringTok{"with"}\NormalTok{, low, }\StringTok{"and"}\NormalTok{, high)}

\NormalTok{parameters }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [}\StringTok{'some matrix'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'lower bound'}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{named_parameters }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ \{}\StringTok{'high'}\NormalTok{: }\StringTok{'upper bound'}\NormalTok{\}}
\NormalTok{trim_value(}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{parameters, }\OperatorTok{**}\NormalTok{named_parameters)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
some matrix with lower bound and upper bound
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{use-destructuring-to-assign-multiple-values-at-once}{%
\subsection{Use destructuring to assign multiple values at once}\label{use-destructuring-to-assign-multiple-values-at-once}}

One last feature of Python is
\gref{destructuring assignment}{destructuring\_assignment}.\index{Python!destructuring assignment}\index{destructuring assignment (in Python)}
Suppose we have a nested list such as \texttt{{[}1,\ {[}2,\ 3{]}{]}},
and we want to assign its numbers to three variables
called \texttt{first}, \texttt{second}, and \texttt{third}.
Instead of writing this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{first }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ values[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{second }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ values[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{][}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{third }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ values[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{][}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

we can write this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{[first, [second, third]] }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, [}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{]]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In general,
if the variables on the left are arranged in the same way as the values on the right,
Python will automatically unpack the values and assign them correctly.
This is particularly useful when looping over lists of structured values:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{people }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [}
\NormalTok{    [[}\StringTok{'Kay'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'McNulty'}\NormalTok{], }\StringTok{'mcnulty@eniac.org'}\NormalTok{],}
\NormalTok{    [[}\StringTok{'Betty'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'Jennings'}\NormalTok{], }\StringTok{'jennings@eniac.org'}\NormalTok{],}
\NormalTok{    [[}\StringTok{'Marlyn'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'Wescoff'}\NormalTok{], }\StringTok{'mwescoff@eniac.org'}\NormalTok{]}
\NormalTok{]}
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ [[first, last], email] }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ people:}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'}\SpecialCharTok{\{first\}}\StringTok{ }\SpecialCharTok{\{last\}}\StringTok{ <}\SpecialCharTok{\{email\}}\StringTok{>'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{Summary}\label{style-summary}}

George Orwell laid out \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_and_the_English_Language\#Remedy_of_Six_Rules}{six rules for good writing},
the last and most important of which is,
\enquote{Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.}
PEP8 conveys \href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds}{the same message}:
there will always be cases where your code will be easier to understand
if you \emph{don't} do the things described in this lesson,
but there are probably fewer of them than you think.

\hypertarget{documentation}{%
\chapter{Documenting Programs}\label{documentation}}

An old proverb says, \enquote{Trust, but verify.}
The equivalent in programming is, \enquote{Be clear, but document.}
No matter how well software is written,
it always embodies decisions that aren't explicit in the final code
or accommodates complications that aren't going to be obvious to the next reader.
Putting it another way,
the best function names in the world aren't going to answer the questions
\enquote{Why does the software do this?}
and
\enquote{Why doesn't it do this in a simpler way?}

In this appendix we address some issues that commonly arise
when people start to think about documenting their software.
We start with tips for writing good docstrings,
before considering more detailed documentation
like tutorials, cookbooks and frequently-asked question
(\gref{FAQ}{faq}\index{FAQ (Frequency Asked Questions)}\index{Python package!FAQ}) lists.
Clearly defining your audience can make it easier to determine
which types of documentation you need to provide,
and there are a number of things you can do to reduce the
work involved in providing support for FAQs.

\hypertarget{documentation-docstrings}{%
\section{Writing Good Docstrings}\label{documentation-docstrings}}

If we are doing \gref{exploratory programming}{exploratory\_programming},
a short \gref{docstring}{docstring} to remind ourselves of each function's purpose\index{docstring (in Python)}\index{Python!docstring}
is probably as much documentation as we need.
(In fact, it's probably better than what most people do.)
That one- or two-liner should begin with an active verb and describe either
how inputs are turned into outputs,
or what side effects the function has;
as we discuss below,
if we need to describe both,
we should probably rewrite our function.

An active verb is something like \enquote{extract}, \enquote{normalize}, or \enquote{find}.
For example,
these are all good one-line docstrings:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \enquote{Create a list of current ages from a list of birth dates.}
\item
  \enquote{Clip signals to lie in {[}0\ldots1{]}.}
\item
  \enquote{Reduce the red component of each pixel.}
\end{itemize}

We can tell our one-liners are useful if we can read them aloud in the order the functions are called
in place of the function's name and parameters.

Once we start writing code for other people (or our future selves)
our docstrings should include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The name and purpose of every public class, function, and constant in our code.
\item
  The name, purpose, and default value (if any) of every parameter to every function.
\item
  Any side effects the function has.
\item
  The type of value returned by every function.
\item
  What exceptions those functions can raise and when.
\end{enumerate}

The word \enquote{public} in the first rule is important.
We don't have to write full documentation for helper functions
that are only used inside our package and aren't meant to be called by users,
but these should still have at least a comment explaining their purpose.
We also don't have to document unit testing functions:
as discussed in Chapter~\ref{testing},
these should have long names that describe what they're checking
so that failure reports are easy to scan.

\hypertarget{documentation-audience}{%
\section{Defining Your Audience}\label{documentation-audience}}

It's important to consider who documentation is for.
There are three kinds of people in any domain:
\gref{novices}{novice},
\gref{competent practitioners}{competent\_practitioner},
and \gref{experts}{expert} (Wilson \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wils2018}{2019}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wils2018}{a}).
A novice doesn't yet have a \gref{mental model}{mental\_model} of the domain:
they don't know what the key terms are,
how they relate,
what the causes of their problems are,
or how to tell whether a solution to their problem is appropriate or not.

Competent practitioners know enough to accomplish routine tasks with routine effort:
they may need to check \href{https://stackoverflow.com/}{Stack Overflow} every few minutes,
but they know what to search for and what \enquote{done} looks like.

Finally,
experts have such a deep and broad understanding of the domain
that they can solve routine problems at a glance
and are able to handle the one-in-a-thousand cases
that would baffle the merely competent.

Each of these three groups needs a different kind of documentation:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A novice needs a tutorial that introduces her to key ideas one by one
  and shows how they fit together.
\item
  A competent practitioner needs reference guides, cookbooks, and Q\&A sites;
  these give her solutions close enough to what she needs
  that she can tweak them the rest of the way.
\item
  Experts need this material as well---nobody's memory is perfect---but
  they may also paradoxically want tutorials.
  The difference between them and novices is that experts want tutorials on how things work
  and why they were designed that way.
\end{itemize}

The first thing to decide when writing documentation
is therefore to decide which of these needs we are trying to meet.
Tutorials like this book should be long-form prose that contain code samples and diagrams.
They should use \gref{authentic tasks}{authentic\_task} to motivate ideas,
i.e.,
show people things they actually want to do rather than printing the numbers from 1 to 10,
and should include regular check-ins
so that learners and instructors alike can tell if they're making progress.

Tutorials help novices build a mental model,
but competent practitioners and experts will be frustrated by their slow pace and low information density.
They will want single-point solutions to specific problems like
how to find cells in a spreadsheet that contain a certain string
or how to configure the web server to load an access control module.
They can make use of an alphabetical list of the functions in a library,
but are much happier if they can search by keyword to find what they need;
one of the signs that someone is no longer a novice is that
they're able to compose useful queries and tell if the results are on the right track or not.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{False Beginners}

A \gref{false beginner}{false\_beginner} is someone who appears not to know anything,
but who has enough prior experience in other domains
to be able to piece things together much more quickly than a genuine novice.
Someone who is proficient with MATLAB, for example,
will speed through a tutorial on Python's numerical libraries
much more quickly than someone who has never programmed before.
Creating documentation for false beginners is especially challenging;
if resources permit,
the best option is often a translation guide
that shows them how they would do a task with the system they know well
and then how to do the equivalent task with the new system.
\end{quote}

In an ideal world,
we would satisfy these needs with a chorus of explanations (Caulfield \protect\hyperlink{ref-Caul2016}{2016}),
some long and detailed,
others short and to the point.
In our world, though,
time and resources are limited,
so all but the most popular packages must make do with single explanations.

\hypertarget{documentation-faq}{%
\section{Creating a FAQ}\label{documentation-faq}}

As projects grow,
documentation within functions alone may be insufficient for users to apply code to their own problems.
One strategy to assist other people with understanding a project is with
an \gref{FAQ}{faq}:
a list of frequently-asked questions and corresponding answers.
A good FAQ uses the terms and concepts that people bring to the software
rather than the vocabulary of its authors;
putting it another way,
the questions should be things that people might search for online,
and the answers should give them enough information to solve their problem.

Creating and maintaining a FAQ is a lot of work,
and unless the community is large and active,
a lot of that effort may turn out to be wasted,
because it's hard for the authors or maintainers of a piece of software
to anticipate what newcomers will be mystified by.
A better approach is to leverage sites like \href{https://stackoverflow.com/}{Stack Overflow},
which is where most programmers are going to look for answers anyway:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Post every question that someone actually asks us,
  whether it's online, by email, or in person.
  Be sure to include the name of the software package in the question
  so that it's findable.
\item
  Answer the question,
  making sure to mention which version of the software we're talking about
  (so that people can easily spot and discard stale answers in the future).
\end{enumerate}

\href{https://stackoverflow.com/}{Stack Overflow}'s guide to \href{https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask}{asking a good question}
has been refined over many years,
and is a good guide for any project:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Write the most specific title we can.]
\enquote{Why does division sometimes give a different result in Python 2.7 and Python 3.5?}
is much better than, \enquote{Help! Math in Python!!}
\item[Give context before giving sample code.]
A few sentences to explain what are are trying to do and why
will help people determine if their question is a close match to ours or not.
\item[Provide a minimal reprex.]
Section~\ref{teams-bugs} explains the value of a \gref{reproducible example}{reprex},
and why reprexes should be as short as possible.
Readers will have a much easier time figuring out if this question and its answers are for them
if they can see \emph{and understand} a few lines of code.
\item[Tag, tag, tag.\index{tags (for documentation)}]
Keywords make everything more findable,
from scientific papers to left-handed musical instruments.
\item[Use \enquote{I} and question words (how/what/when/where/why).]
Writing this way forces us to think more clearly about
what someone might actually be thinking when they need help.
\item[Keep each item short.]
The \enquote{minimal manual} approach to instructional design (Carroll \protect\hyperlink{ref-Carr2014}{2014})
breaks everything down into single-page steps,
with half of that page devoted to troubleshooting.
This may feel trivializing to the person doing the writing,
but is often as much as a person searching and reading can handle.
It also helps writers realize just how much implicit knowledge they are assuming.
\item[Allow for a chorus of explanations.]
As discussed earlier,
users are all different from one another,
and are therefore best served by a chorus of explanations.
Do not be afraid of providing multiple explanations to a single question
that suggest different approaches
or are written for different prior levels of understanding.
\end{description}

\hypertarget{yaml}{%
\chapter{YAML}\label{yaml}}

\gref{YAML}{yaml\_glossary}\index{YAML} is a way to write nested data structures in plain text
that is often used to specify configuration options for software.
The acronym stands for \enquote{YAML Ain't Markup Language},
but that's a lie:
YAML doesn't use \texttt{\textless{}tags\textgreater{}} like HTML,
but can still be quite fussy about what is allowed to appear where.

Throughout this book we use YAML to
configure our plotting script (Chapter \ref{config}),
continuous integration with Travis CI (Section \ref{testing-ci}),
software environment with \texttt{conda} (Section \ref{provenance-code-environment}),
and a documentation website with Read the Docs (Section \ref{packaging-rtd}).
While you don't need to be an expert in YAML to complete tasks like these,
this appendix outlines some basics that can help make things easier.

A simple YAML file has one key-value pair on each line
with a colon separating the key from the value:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{project-name}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ planet earth}
\FunctionTok{purpose}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ science fair}
\FunctionTok{moons}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here,
the keys are \texttt{"project-name"}, \texttt{"purpose"}, and \texttt{"moons"},
and the values are \texttt{"planet\ earth"},
\texttt{"science\ fair"},
and (hopefully) the number 1,
since most YAML implementations try to guess the type of data.

If we want to create a list of values without keys,
we can write it either using square brackets (like a Python array)
or dashed items (like a Markdown\index{Markdown} list),
so:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rotation-time}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\KeywordTok{[}\StringTok{"1 year"}\KeywordTok{,}\AttributeTok{ }\StringTok{"12 months"}\KeywordTok{,}\AttributeTok{ }\StringTok{"365.25 days"}\KeywordTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rotation-time}\KeywordTok{:}
\AttributeTok{    }\KeywordTok{-}\AttributeTok{ 1 year}
\AttributeTok{    }\KeywordTok{-}\AttributeTok{ 12 months}
\AttributeTok{    }\KeywordTok{-}\AttributeTok{ 365.25 days}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

are equivalent.
(The indentation isn't absolutely required in this case,
but helps make the intention clear.)
If we want to write entire paragraphs,
we can use a marker to show that a value spans multiple lines:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{feedback}\KeywordTok{: }\CharTok{|}
\NormalTok{    Neat molten core concept.}
\NormalTok{    Too much water.}
\NormalTok{    Could have used more imaginative ending.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can also add comments using \texttt{\#} just as we do in many programming languages.

YAML is easy to understand when used this way,
but it starts to get tricky as soon as sub-lists and sub-keys appear.
For example,
this is part of the YAML configuration file for formatting this book:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\AttributeTok{bookdown:}\FunctionTok{:gitbook}\KeywordTok{:}
\AttributeTok{  }\FunctionTok{highlight}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ tango}
\AttributeTok{  }\FunctionTok{config}\KeywordTok{:}
\AttributeTok{    }\FunctionTok{download}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\KeywordTok{[}\StringTok{"pdf"}\KeywordTok{,}\AttributeTok{ }\StringTok{"epub"}\KeywordTok{]}
\AttributeTok{    }\FunctionTok{toc}\KeywordTok{:}
\AttributeTok{      }\FunctionTok{collapse}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ section}
\FunctionTok{      before}\KeywordTok{: }\CharTok{|}
\NormalTok{        <li><a href="./">Merely Useful</a></li>}
\AttributeTok{    }\FunctionTok{sharing}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ }\CharTok{no}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

It corresponds to the following Python data structure:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{\{}
  \StringTok{'bookdown::gitbook'}\NormalTok{: \{}
    \StringTok{'highlight'}\NormalTok{: }\StringTok{'tango'}\NormalTok{,}
    \StringTok{'config'}\NormalTok{: \{}
      \StringTok{'download'}\NormalTok{: [}
        \StringTok{'pdf'}\NormalTok{,}
        \StringTok{'epub'}
\NormalTok{      ],}
      \StringTok{'toc'}\NormalTok{: \{}
        \StringTok{'collapse'}\NormalTok{: }\StringTok{'section'}\NormalTok{,}
        \StringTok{'before'}\NormalTok{: }\StringTok{'<li><a href="./">Merely Useful</a></li>}\CharTok{\textbackslash{}n}\StringTok{'}
\NormalTok{      \}}
      \StringTok{'sharing'}\NormalTok{: }\VariableTok{False}
\NormalTok{    \}}
\NormalTok{  \}}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{anaconda}{%
\chapter{Anaconda}\label{anaconda}}

When people first started using Python for data science,
installing the relevant libraries could be difficult.\index{package installation}
The main problem was that the Python package installer (\href{https://pypi.org/project/pip/}{\texttt{pip}})\index{pip}
only worked for libraries written in pure Python.
Many scientific Python libraries have C and/or Fortran dependencies,
so it was left up to data scientists
(who often do not have a background in system administration)
to figure out how to install those dependencies themselves.
To overcome this problem,
a number of scientific Python \gref{distributions}{software\_distribution}\index{Python distribution}
have been released over the years.
These come with the most popular data science libraries and their dependencies pre-installed,
and some also come with a package manager to assist
with installing additional libraries that weren't pre-installed.
Today the most popular distribution for data science is \href{https://www.anaconda.com/}{Anaconda},\index{Anaconda}
which comes with a package (and environment) manager called \href{https://conda.io/}{\texttt{conda}}.\index{conda}
In this appendix we look at some of the most important features of \texttt{conda}
for research software engineers.

\hypertarget{anaconda-conda-package-management}{%
\section{Package Management With conda}\label{anaconda-conda-package-management}}

According to the \href{https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/}{latest documentation},
Anaconda comes with over 250 of the most widely used data science libraries (and their dependencies) pre-installed.
In addition, there are several thousand libraries available via the \texttt{conda\ install} command,
which can be executed at the command line or by using the Anaconda Navigator graphical user interface.
A package manager like conda greatly simplifies the software installation process
by identifying and installing compatible versions of software and all required dependencies.
It also handles the process of updating software as more recent versions become available.
If you don't want to install the entire Anaconda distribution,
you can install \href{https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html}{Miniconda}\index{miniconda} instead.
It essentially comes with \texttt{conda} and nothing else.

\hypertarget{anaconda-cloud}{%
\subsection{Anaconda Cloud}\label{anaconda-cloud}}

What happens if we want to install a Python package
that isn't on the list of the few thousand or so most popular data science packages
(i.e.~the ones that are automatically available via the \texttt{conda\ install} command)?
The answer is the \href{https://anaconda.org/}{Anaconda Cloud} website,
where the community can post \texttt{conda} installation packages.

The utility of the Anaconda Cloud for research software engineers
is best illustrated by an example.
A few years ago, an atmospheric scientist by the name of Andrew Dawson
wrote a Python package called \href{https://ajdawson.github.io/windspharm/latest/}{\texttt{windspharm}}
for performing computations on global wind fields in spherical geometry.
While many of Andrew's colleagues routinely process global wind fields,
atmospheric science is a relatively small field and thus the \texttt{windspharm} package
will never have a big enough user base to make the list of
popular data science packages supported by Anaconda.
Andrew has therefore posted a \texttt{conda} installation package to Anaconda Cloud
(Figure~\ref{fig:anaconda-windspharm-ajdawson})
so that users can install \texttt{windspharm} using \texttt{conda}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{conda}\NormalTok{ install -c ajdawson windspharm}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/anaconda/cloud-windspharm-ajdawson} 

}

\caption{The windspharm conda installation package on Anaconda Cloud.}\label{fig:anaconda-windspharm-ajdawson}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{conda} documentation has \href{https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs-skeleton.html}{instructions} for quickly building
a \texttt{conda} package for a Python module that is already available on \href{https://pypi.org/}{PyPI}
(Section~\ref{packaging-distribute}).

\hypertarget{conda-forge}{%
\subsection{conda-forge}\label{conda-forge}}

It turns out there are often multiple installation packages for the same library
up on Anaconda Cloud (e.g.~Figure~\ref{fig:anaconda-windspharm-search}).
To try and address this duplication problem \href{https://conda-forge.org/}{conda-forge} was launched,
which aims to be a central repository that contains just a single, up-to-date (and working)
version of each installation package on Anaconda Cloud.
You can therefore expand the selection of packages available via \texttt{conda\ install}
beyond the chosen few thousand by adding the conda-forge channel to your \texttt{conda} configuration:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\ExtensionTok{conda}\NormalTok{ config --add channels conda-forge}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/anaconda/cloud-windspharm-search} 

}

\caption{Search results for the windspharm package on Anaconda Cloud.}\label{fig:anaconda-windspharm-search}
\end{figure}

The conda-forge website has \href{https://conda-forge.org/\#add_recipe}{instructions}
for adding a \texttt{conda} installation package to the conda-forge repository.

\hypertarget{anaconda-environments}{%
\section{Environment Management With conda}\label{anaconda-environments}}

If you are working on several data science projects at once,
installing all the libraries you need in the same place
(i.e.~the system default location) can become problematic.
This is especially true if the projects rely on different versions of the same package,
or if you are developing a new package and need to try new things.
The way to avoid these issues is to create different
\gref{virtual environments}{virtual\_environment}\index{virtual environment (in Python)} for different projects/tasks.
The original environment manager for Python development was \href{https://virtualenv.pypa.io/}{\texttt{virtualenv}},
which has been more recently superseded by \href{https://docs.pipenv.org/}{\texttt{pipenv}}.
The advantage that \texttt{conda} has over these options is that it is language agnostic
(i.e.~you can isolate non-Python packages in your environments too) and
supports binary packages (i.e.~you don't need to compile the source code after installing),
so it has become the environment manager of choice in data science.
In this book \texttt{conda} is used to export the details of an environment
when documenting the computational methodology for a report (Section~\ref{provenance-code})
and to test how a new package installs without disturbing anything
in our main Python installation (Section~\ref{packaging-virtualenv}).

\hypertarget{glossary}{%
\chapter{Glossary}\label{glossary}}

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[\textbf{abandonware}]
Software that is no longer being maintained.
\item[\textbf{absolute error}]
The absolute value of the difference between the observed and the correct value. Absolute error is usually less useful than \gref{relative error}{relative\_error}.
\item[\textbf{absolute import}]
In Python, an import that specifies the full location of the file to be imported.
\item[\textbf{absolute path}]
A path that points to the same location in the \gref{filesystem}{filesystem} regardless of where it is evaluated. An absolute path is the equivalent of latitude and longitude in geography. See also: \protect\hyperlink{relative_path}{relative path}
\item[\textbf{actual result (of test)}]
The value generated by running code in a test. If this matches the \gref{expected result}{expected\_result}, the test \gref{passes}{pass\_test}; if the two are different, the test \gref{fails}{fail\_test}.
\item[\textbf{agile development}]
A software development methodology that emphasizes lots of small steps and continuous feedback instead of up-front planning and long-term scheduling. \gref{Exploratory programming}{exploratory\_programming} is often agile.
\item[\textbf{ally}]
Someone who actively promotes and supports inclusivity.
\item[\textbf{append mode}]
To add data to the end of an existing file instead of overwriting the previous contents of that file. Overwriting is the default, so most programming languages require programs to be explicit about wanting to append instead.
\item[\textbf{assertion}]
A \gref{Boolean}{boolean} expression that must be \gref{true}{true} at a certain point in a program. Assertions may be built into the language (e.g., \gref{Python}{python}'s \texttt{assert} statement) or provided as functions (e.g., \gref{R}{r\_language}'s \texttt{stopifnot}). They are often used in testing, but are also put in \gref{production code}{production\_code} to check that it is behaving correctly. In many languages, assertions should not be used to perform data-validation as they may be silently dropped by compilers and interpreters under optimization conditions. Using assertions for data validation can therefore introduce security risks. Unlike many languages, R does not have an \texttt{assert} statement which can be disabled, and so use of \gref{package}{package} such as \texttt{assertr} for data validation does not create security holes.
\item[\textbf{authentic task}]
A task which contains important elements of things that learners would do in real (non-classroom situations).
\item[\textbf{auto-completion}]
A feature that allows the user to finish a word or code quickly through the use of pressing the TAB key to list possible words or code from which the user can select.
\item[\textbf{automatic variable}]
A variable that is automatically given a value in a \gref{build rule}{build\_rule}. For example, Make automatically assigns the name of a rule's \gref{target}{build\_target} to the automatic variable \texttt{\$@}. Automatic variables are frequently used when writing \gref{pattern rules}{pattern\_rule}. See also: \protect\hyperlink{makefile}{Makefile}
\item[\textbf{boilerplate}]
Standard text that is included in legal contracts, licenses, and so on.
\item[\textbf{branch-per-feature workflow}]
A common strategy for managing work with \gref{Git}{git} and other \gref{version control systems}{version\_control\_system} in which a separate \gref{branch}{git\_branch} is created for work on each new feature or each \gref{bug}{bug} fix and merged when that work is completed. This isolates changes from one another until they are completed.
\item[\textbf{bug report}]

\item[\textbf{virtual machine}]
A program that pretends to be a computer. This may seem a bit redundant, but VMs are quick to create and start up, and changes made inside the virtual machine are contained within that VM so we can install new \gref{packages}{package} or run a completely different operating system without affecting the underlying computer.
\item[\textbf{whitespace}]
The space, newline, carriage return, and horizontal and vertical tab characters that take up space but do not create a visible mark. The name comes from their appearance on a printed page in the era of typewriters.
